<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

<p>In the following pages it has been my object to trace the
history of the domain lands of Rome from the earliest times to the
establishment of the Empire. The plan of the work has been to
sketch the origin and growth of the idea of private property in
land, the expansion of the <i>ager publicus</i> by the conquest of
neighboring territories, and its absorption by means of sale, by
gift to the people, and by the establishment of colonies, until
wholly merged in private property. This necessarily involves a
history of the agrarian laws, as land distributions were made and
colonies established only in accordance with laws previously
enacted.</p>

<p>My reason for undertaking such a work as the present is found in
the fact that agrarian movements have borne more or less upon every
point in Roman constitutional history, and a proper knowledge of
the former is necessary to a just interpretation of the latter.</p>

<p>This whole question presents numerous obscurities before which
it has been necessary more than once to hesitate; it offers, both
in its entirety and in detail, difficulties which I have at least
earnestly endeavored to lessen. These obscurities and difficulties,
arising in part from insufficiency of historical evidence and in
part from the conflicting statements of the old historians, have
been recognized by all writers and call forth on my part no claim
for indulgence.</p>

<p>This monograph is intended as a chapter merely of a history of
the public lands and agrarian laws of Rome, written for the purpose
of a future comparison with the more recent agrarian movements in
England and America.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <a name="I">I.</a></h3>

<h4>SEC. <a name="I1">1.</a>&mdash;LANDED PROPERTY.</h4>

<br />
<p>The Romans were a people that originally gave their almost
exclusive attention to agriculture and stock-raising. The surnames
of the most illustrious families, as Piso (miller), Porcius
(swine-raiser), Lactucinius (lettuce-raiser), Stolo (a shoot),
etc., prove this. To say that a man was a good farmer was, at one
time, to bestow upon him the highest praise.<span class=
"note">[1]</span> This character, joined to the spirit of order and
private avarice which in a marked degree distinguished the Romans,
has contributed to the development among them of a civil law which
is perhaps the most remarkable monument which antiquity has left
us. This civil code has become the basis of the law of European
peoples, and recommends the civilization of Rome to the veneration
of mankind.</p>

<p>The corner-stone of this legislation was the constitution of the
law of property.<span class="note">[2]</span> This property applies
itself to everything in the law of Rome, to land, to persons and to
obligations.</p>

<p><i>Urbs</i>, the name of the village, takes its origin,
according to an etymology given by Varro,<span class=
"note">[3]</span> from the furrow which the plow traced about the
habitations of the earliest dwellers. But what is of more interest
to us is that the legal signification of <i>Urbs</i> and
<i>Roma</i> was different. The former was the village comprised
within the sacred enclosure; the latter was the total agglomeration
of habitations which composed the village, properly<span class=
"note">[4]</span> so called, and the outskirts, or suburbs. The
powers of certain magistrates ceased with the sacred limits of the
<i>Urbs</i>, while the privileges accorded to a citizen of Rome
extended to the village and the suburbs and finally embraced the
entire Roman world.</p>

<p>The most ancient documents which have reached us from the
history of India and Egypt reveal that they had landed property
fully established, while Roman annals reveal to us the very
creation of this institution. Whatever modern criticism may deduce,
Dionysius, Plutarch, Livy, and Cicero agree in representing the
first king of Rome as merely establishing public property in Roman
soil. This national property, the people possessed in common and
not individually. Such appears to us to be the quiritarian property
<i>par excellence</i><span class="note">[5]</span> and its
primitive form was a variety of public community<span class=
"note">[6]</span> of which individual property was but a later
solemn emancipation. To this historic theory attaches the true
notion of quiritarian land of which we will speak in greater detail
hereafter.</p>

<p>As regards the organization and constitution of individual and
private property, the traditions themselves attribute this to the
second king of Rome, the real founder of Roman society, who divided
the territory among the citizens, marking off the limits of
individual shares and placing them under the protection of
religion. In this way a religious charter was granted to the
institutions of private property. Thus a primitive division of
territory appears to have been the basis of these varied
traditions, but the precise form of this division eludes us.</p>

<p>The Roman territory was confined for many ages to a surface of
very limited extent, which properly bore the name of <i>Ager
Romanus</i>. This name with signification slightly changed appeared
to be still in use in the time of the empire, and even at the
present day a portion of the Roman territory which very nearly
corresponds to the ancient territory of the imperial period is
called <i>Agro Romano.</i><span class="note">[7]</span> That which
was properly called <i>Ager Romanus</i> at first only occupied the
surface of a slightly expanded arc whose chord was the river
Tiber.<span class="note">[8]</span> Primitive Rome did not extend
beyond the Tiber into Etruria, and toward Latium her possessions
did not extend beyond the limits of some five or six miles
reckoning from the Palatine. Toward the east the towns of Antemnae,
Fidenae, Caenina, Collatia and Gabia lay in the immediate
neighborhood, thus limiting the extension of the city in that
direction within a radius of five or six miles;<span class=
"note">[9]</span> and northward the Anio<span class=
"note">[10]</span> formed the limit. To the southwest as you
approach Lavinium, the sixth milestone marked the boundary of Rome.
Thus with the possible exception of a small strip of land extending
upon either bank of the Tiber to its mouth, and embracing the old
site<span class="note">[11]</span> of Ostia, have we marked out all
of ancient Rome. Strabo<span class="note">[12]</span> says it could
be gone round in a single day. And according to this same author it
was within these limits that the annual auspices<span class=
"note">[13]</span> could be taken.</p>

<p>Both city and land increased with time. Property seemed to have
been added and lost successively during the reign of the
kings.<span class="note">[14]</span> The last increase of the
<i>Ager Romanus</i> was due to the labors of Servius Tullius, and
it was in the reign of this king that it reached its greatest
limit. Dionysius<span class="note">[15]</span> says: "As soon as he
(Servius) was invested with the government, he divided the public
lands among such of the Romans as having no lands of their own,
cultivated those of others.... He added two hills to the city, that
called the Viminal and the Esquiline hill, each of which forms a
considerable city; these he divided among such Romans as had no
houses, to the intent that they might build them.... This king was
the last who enlarged the circumference of the city by the addition
of these two hills to the other five, having first consulted the
auspices as the law decided, and performed the other religious
rites. Further than this the city has not since then been
extended." Without doubt these possessions received great additions
in later times,<span class="note">[16]</span> but they were not
incorporated in the <i>Ager Romanus</i> as the preceding had been.
The subjugated territories kept their ancient names while their
lands were made the object of distributions to the people, of
public sales to the citizens who also extended their possessions
outside of Roman<span class="note">[17]</span> territory, or else
the new conquests were abandoned to municipia, given up to
colonies, or became a part of that which was called <i>Ager
Publicus</i>. In fine, it was a fundamental principle of the public
law of Rome that the lands and the persons of the people conquered
belonged to the conqueror, the Roman people, who either in person
or by their delegates disposed of them as it seemed best. Among the
ancients war always decided concerning both liberty and
property.</p>

<p>The result of all these facts was that the Roman territory was
made the object of a division or a primitive distribution either
among the three races of the first population, or a little later
among the citizens or inhabitants. This very same principle has
been frequently observed in recent times in regard to
confiscated<span class="note">[18]</span> territories and conquered
peoples.</p>

<p>Now what was the allotment of the first distribution of
land?</p>

<p>Upon this topic the ancient authorities are blind and confusing
to such an extent as to be wholly inadequate for the solution of
the difficulty. Among the more recent authorities, two opposing
systems have been sustained, the one represented by Montesquieu,
and the other by Niebuhr.</p>

<blockquote>(1) According to Montesquieu, the kings of Rome divided
the land into perfectly equal lots for all the citizens and the
title of the law of the Twelve Tables relative to successions was
for no other object than to establish this ancient equality of the
division of lands.<span class="note">[19]</span><br />
<br />
(2) Niebuhr,<span class="note">[20]</span> on the contrary, claimed
that territorial property was primitively the attribute of the
patriciate and everyone who was not a member of this noble race was
incapable of possessing any part of the territory. From this theory
the author deduced numerous consequences which are important both
to law and history.</blockquote>

<p>Neither of these systems is free from errors. Montesquieu seems
to have made no difference between patrician and plebeian in using
the term <i>citizen</i>, while it is no longer disputed that the
plebeian was not a burgess and consequently had no civic rights
save those granted to him by the ruling class. His idea of goods
must have, at least, become chimerical at a very early date, as
this equality was so little suspected by the ancients that
Plutarch,<span class="note">[21]</span> after having spoken of the
efforts of Lycurgus to overturn the inequality of wealth among the
Spartans, accuses Numa of having neglected a necessity so
important. It is moreover difficult to see how Montesquieu could
think that testamentary disposition tended to maintain equality
when the privilege was accorded to every citizen of disposing of
his entire patrimony by will even to the prejudice of his
children.<span class="note">[22]</span> Again, the law of debts was
hardly favorable<span class="note">[23]</span> to equality.</p>

<p>Niebuhr clearly<span class="note">[24]</span> denied the
existence of the plebs until Ancus incorporated the Latins and
bestowed upon them peculiar privileges thus forming a new and third
class distinct from both patricians and clients. Had Niebuhr
succeeded in establishing this view, the right to landed property
would appear to be wholly vested in the patricians, for a client,
from the very nature of his position, could hold nothing
independent of his master. But this theory has fallen to the ground
and no writer of the present day pretends to uphold it. The
plebeians existed from the very first and some of them held land in
full private ownership very little different from the quiritarian
ownership of the patricians. Cicero, who in his Republic<span
class="note">[25]</span> has occupied himself with the ancient
constitution of Rome and has spoken in detail of the division of
the lands, always speaks of the distribution among the citizens
without regard to quality of patrician or plebeian, <i>divisit
viritim civibus</i>. He has nowhere written that territorial riches
were the exclusive appanage of the patriciate. It must be
confessed, however, that it is doubtful whether he intended to
embrace the plebeians in his <i>civibus</i>. For more than two
centuries before the time of Cicero the plebeians had enjoyed the
full rights of Roman citizenship, but for more than that length of
time property had been concentrated in the hands of the
aristocracy. This result was the consequence of the Roman
constitution<span class="note">[26]</span> and the establishment of
a populous city in the midst of a narrow surrounding country. Roman
policy had never been conducive to this concentration, and it will
hereafter appear that the nobility who had the chief direction and
administration of public affairs had little by little usurped the
property which formed the domain of the state, <i>i.e. Ager
Publicus</i>, and swallowed up the revenues due the treasury.</p>

<h4>SEC. <a name="I2">2.</a>&mdash;QUIRITARIAN OWNERSHIP.</h4>

<br />
<p>Citizenship was the first requisite to the right of property in
Roman territory. This rule, although invariable and inherent in the
Roman state, bent under the influence of international politics or
the philosophy of law, yet its severity affords us a notable
characteristic of the law of ancient Rome. Cicero and Gaius have
preserved to us an important monument of this law in a fragment of
the Twelve Tables which proclaims the solemn principle, <i>adversus
hostem aeterna auctoritas esto.<span class="note">[1]</span>
Hostis</i> in the old Latin language was synonymous with stranger,
<i>perigrinus</i><span class="note">[2]</span> This Roman name was
moreover applied to a person who had forfeited the protection of
the law by reason of a criminal condemnation, and who was therefore
designated <i>peregrinus</i>.<span class="note">[3]</span></p>

<p><i>Auctoritas</i> also had in old Latin a different
signification from what it has in later Latin. It expressed the
idea of the right to claim and defend in equity. It was very nearly
equivalent to the right of property.<span class="note">[4]</span>
The sense of the Roman law was, then, that the <i>peregrinus</i>
could not bar or proceed against a Roman, a disposition somewhat
similar to the old law of England.<span class="note">[5]</span> And
as it was necessary to be a citizen in order to acquire by the
civil and solemn means which dominated the law of property in Rome,
it followed that the <i>peregrini</i> were excluded from all right
to property in land by these laws. This exclusive legislation for a
long time governed Europe and did not disappear even from the Code
Napoleon of 1819.<span class="note">[6]</span></p>

<p>We have a forcible example of the severity of the old Roman law
in this regard in the text of Gaius,&mdash;<i>Aut enim ex jure
quiritium unusquisque dominus erat, aut non intelligebatur
dominus.</i><span class="note">[7]</span></p>

<p><i>Dominium</i> was therefore inseparable from <i>Jus
Quiritium,</i> the law of the Roman city, the <i>optimum jus civium
Romanorum</i>. The <i>peregrinus</i> was excluded from landed
property both Roman and private; he could neither inherit nor
transmit; claim nor defend in equity. Moreover the name
<i>peregrinus</i> was not confined to the stranger proper but was
also bestowed upon subjects of Rome<span class="note">[8]</span>
who, being deprived of their property and also of political liberty
by right of conquest, had not received the right of citizenship
which was for a long time confined within very narrow limits. It
would thus appear conclusive from the law quoted that the client
and plebeian could not at first hold land <i>optimo ex jure
quiritium</i>.</p>

<p>Thus the tenure of the patricians was threefold: First, they had
full property in the land; second, they had a seigniorial right,
<i>jus in re</i>, in the land of their clients and the plebeians
whose property belonged to the <i>populus, i.e</i>. the generality
of the patricians; in the third place, in their own hands, they
held lands which were portions of the domain and which were held by
a very precarious tenure called <i>possessio</i>.</p>

<p>According to Ihne, all lands in Rome were held by the above
mentioned tenure until the enactment of the Icilian law <i>de
Aventino publicando</i> which involved a change of tenure by
converting the former dependent and incumbered tenure of the
plebeians into full property.</p>

<h4>SEC. <a name="I3">3.</a>&mdash;AGER PUBLICUS.</h4>

<p>In her early history Rome was continually making fresh
conquests, and in this way adding to her territory.<span class=
"note">[1]</span> She steadfastly pursued a course of destruction
to her neighbors in order that she might thereby grow rich and
powerful. In this way large tracts of territory became Roman land,
the property of the state or <i>Ager Publicus.</i><span class=
"note">[2]</span></p>

<p>This public land extended in proportion to the success of the
Roman arms, since the confiscation of the territory of the
vanquished was, in the absence of more favorable terms, a part of
the law of war. All conquered lands before being granted or sold to
private individuals were <i>Ager Publicus</i><span class=
"note">[3]</span> a term which with few exceptions came to embrace
the whole Roman world.</p>

<p>This <i>Ager Publieus</i> was farther increased by towns<span
class="note">[4]</span> voluntarily surrendering themselves to Rome
without awaiting the iron hand of war. These were commonly mulcted
of one-third of their land.<span class="note">[5]</span> "The soil
of the country is not the product of labor any more than is water
or air. Individual citizens cannot therefore lay any claim to
lawful property in land as to anything<span class="note">[6]</span>
produced by their own hands." The state in this case, as the
representative of the rights and interests of society, decides how
the land shall be divided among the members of the community, and
the rules laid down by the state to regulate this matter are of the
first and highest importance in determining the civil condition of
the country and the prosperity of the people. Whenever but one
class among the people is privileged to have property in land a
most exclusive oligarchy is formed.<span class="note">[7]</span>
When the land is held in small portions by a great number and
nobody is legally or practically excluded from acquiring land,
there we find provided the elements of democracy.</p>

<p>According to the strictest right of conquest in antiquity the
defeated lost not only their personal freedom, their moveable and
landed<span class="note">[8]</span> property, but even life itself.
All was at the mercy of the conquerors. In practice a modification
of this right took place and in Rome extreme severity was applied
only in extreme cases, generally as a punishment for treason.<span
class="note">[9]</span></p>

<p>This magnanimity was not rare and it even went so far as to
restore the whole of the territory to the people subdued.<span
class="note">[10]</span> But let us not suppose that this humanity
toward a conquered people sprang from any pity inspired by their
forlorn condition. It was due merely to the interest of the
conquerors themselves. The conquered lands must still be cultivated
and the depleted population restored. For this reason the conquered
had generally not only life and freedom left them but also the
means of livelihood, <i>i.e</i>. some portion of their land. This
portion they held subject to no restrictions or services save those
levied upon quiritarian property. It was private property to the
full legal extent of the expression, thus being in the unlimited
disposition of the individual.<span class="note">[11]</span> These
people formed the nucleus of the plebeians, the freemen who were
members of the Roman state<span class="note">[12]</span> without
actually having any political rights.</p>

<p>The <i>Ager Publicus</i> was the property of the state and as
such could be alienated only by the state.<span class=
"note">[13]</span> This alienation could be accomplished in two
ways:</p>

<blockquote>(a). By public sale;<br />
<br />
 (b). By gratuitous distribution.<br />
<br />
 (a). The public sale was merely an auction to the highest bidder
and in the later days of the monarchy and early part of the
republic, rich plebeians must have become possessed of large tracts
of land in this way; the privilege of acquiring property in land
having been extended to them some time before the Servian
reform.<span class="note">[14]</span><br />
<br />
 (b). The gratuitous distribution of land was accomplished by means
of Agrarian Laws or royal grant and had for its object the
establishment of colonies for purposes of defence, the rewarding of
veterans or meritorious soldiers,<span class="note">[15]</span> or
in later times, the providing for impoverished plebeians.<br />
<br />
</blockquote>

<p>But even in the earliest times a portion of the domain lands was
excluded from sale or private appropriation,<span class=
"note">[16]</span> in order to serve as a resource for the needs of
the state.</p>

<p>This was the general usage of ancient republics and this maxim
of reserved lands was recommended<span class="note">[17]</span> by
Aristotle as the first principle of political economy.</p>

<p>Such reserved <i>ager publicus</i> was leased either in periods
of five years (quinquennial leaseholds) or perpetually, <i>i.e.</i>
, by emphyteutic lease or copyhold. From these lands<span class=
"note">[18]</span> the treasury received an income of from
one-tenth to one-fifth of the annual crops.</p>

<p>Besides these legal methods mentioned there was another very
common one which was seemingly never established by any law and
therefore existed merely by title of tolerance. I speak of the
indefinite <i>possessio</i> which was nothing but an occupation on
the part of the patricians<span class="note">[19]</span> of the
land belonging to the state and was in nature quite similar to the
so-called "squatting" commonly practiced in some of our western
states and territories. The title to the enjoyment of the public
lands was at first clearly vested in the patricians nor was this
right extended to the plebeians until after they had been admitted
to full citizenship. With regard to the state the
<i>possessor</i><span class="note">[20]</span> was merely a tenant
at will and could be removed whenever desired; but as regarded
other persons he was like the owner of the soil and could alienate
the land which he occupied either for a term of years, or forever,
as if he were the real proprietor.<span class="note">[21]</span>
The public land thus occupied was looked to as a resource upon the
admission of new citizens. They customarily received a small
freehold according to the general notion of antiquity that a
burgess must be a landowner. This land could only be found by a
divison of that which belonged to the public, and a consequent
ejectment of the tenants at will. In the Greek states every large
accession to the number of citizens was followed by a call for a
division of the public lands and, as this division involved the
sacrifice of many existing interests, it was regarded with aversion
by the old burgesses as an act of revolution.</p>

<p>A great part of the wealth of the Romans consisted in domains of
this kind, and the question will occur to the thoughtful mind how
the government was able to keep the most distinguished part of her
citizens in a legal position so uncertain and alarming. English law
is very different from the Roman in this respect and would decide
in favor of the tenant and against the state. It is fairly possible
that this uncertainty of tenure tended to render the government
more stable and less liable to sudden revolutionary movements, thus
having the same effect upon the Roman government which funded debts
have upon the nations of to-day.</p>

<h4>SEC. <a name="I4">4.</a>&mdash;ROMAN COLONIES.</h4>

<p>Probably in no other way does the Roman government so clearly
reveal its nature and strength as in its method of colonization. No
other nation, ancient or modern, has ever so completely controlled
her colonies as did the Roman. Her civil law, indeed, reflected
itself in both political and international relations. In Greece, as
soon<span class="note">[l]</span> as a boy had attained a certain
age his name was inscribed upon the tribal rolls and henceforth he
was free from the <i>potestas</i> of his father and owed him only
the marks of respect which nature demanded. So too, at a certain
age, the colonies separated themselves from their mother city
without losing their remembrance of a common origin. This was not
so in Rome. The children<span class="note">[2]</span> were always
under the <i>potestas</i> of their parents. By analogy therefore,
the colonies ought to remain subject to their mother city. Greek
colonies went forth into a strange land which had never been
conquered by Hellenic arms or hitherto trod by Grecian foot.
Roman<span class="note">[3]</span> colonies were established by
government upon land which had been previously conquered and which
therefore belonged to the Roman domain. The Greek was fired with an
ambition to obtain wealth and personal distinction, being wholly
free to bend his efforts to personal ends. Not so the Roman. He
sacrificed self for the good of the state. Instead of the
allurements of wealth he received some six jugera of land, free
from taxation it is true, but barely enough to reward the hardest
labor with scanty subsistence. Instead of the hope of personal
distinction, he in most cases sacrificed the most valuable of his
rights, <i>jus suffragii et jus</i><span class="note">[4]</span>
<i>honorum</i> and suffered what was called <i>capitis
diminutio</i>. He devoted himself, together with wife and family,
to a life-long military service. In fact the Romans used
colonization as a means to strengthen their hold upon<span class=
"note">[5]</span> their conquests in Italy and to extend their
dominion from one centre over a large extent of country. Roman
colonies were not commercial. In this respect they differed from
those of the Phoenicians and Greeks. Their object was essentially
military<span class="note">[6]</span> and from this point of view
they differed from the colonies of both the ancients and moderns.
Their object was the establishment of Roman power. The colonists
marched out as a garrison into a conquered town and were exposed to
dangers on all sides. Every colony acted as a fortress to protect
the boundary and keep subjects to their allegiance to Rome. This
establishment was not a matter of individual choice nor was it left
to any freak of chance. A decree of the senate decided when and
where a colony should be sent out, and the people in their
assemblies elected individual members for colonization.</p>

<p>From another point of view Roman colonies were similar to those
of Greece, since their result was to remove from the centre to
distant places the superabundant population, the dangerous,<span
class="note">[7]</span> unquiet, and turbulent.</p>

<p>But the difference in the location of the colonies was easy to
distinguish. In general the Phoenicians and the Greeks as well as
modern people founded their colonies in unoccupied localities. Here
they raised up new towns which were located in places favorable to
maritime and commercial relations. The Romans, on the contrary,
avoided establishing colonies in new places. When they had taken
possession of a city, they expelled from it a part of the
inhabitants, whether to transfer them to Rome as at first, or a
little later, when it became necessary to discourage the increase
of Roman population, to more distant places. The population thus
expelled was replaced with Roman and Latin citizens.<span class=
"note">[8]</span> Thus a permanent garrison was located which
assured the submission of the neighboring countries and arrested in
its incipiency every attempt at revolt. In every respect these
colonies remained under surveillance and in a dependence the most
complete and absolute upon the mother city, Rome. Colonies never
became the means of providing for the impoverished and degraded
until the time of Gaius Gracchus. When new territory was conquered,
there went the citizen soldier. Thus these colonies mark the growth
of Roman dominion as the circumscribed rings mark the annual growth
of a tree. These colonies were of two kinds, Latin and Roman.</p>

<p>1. Latin colonies were those<span class="note">[9]</span> which
were composed of Latini and Hernici, or Romans enjoying the same
rights as these, <i>i.e.</i> possessed of the Latin right rather
than the Roman franchise. They were established inland as road
fortresses and being located in the vicinity of mountain passes or
main thoroughfares acted as a guard to Rome, and held the enemy in
check.</p>

2. Roman, or Burgess, colonies<span class="note">[10]</span> were
those composed wholly of Roman citizens who kept their political
rights and consequent close union with their native city. In some
cases Latini were given the full franchise and permitted to join
these colonies. In position as well as rights, these colonies were
distinguished from the Latin, being with few exceptions situated
upon the coast and thus acting as guards against foreign invasion.

<h3>CHAPTER <a name="II">II.</a></h3>

<h4>SEC. <a name="II5">5.</a>&mdash;LEX CASSIA.</h4>

<br />
<p>Every year added to the difference between the patrician and
plebeian, the rich and the poor; a difference which had now grown
so great as to threaten seriously the very existence of the state.
The most sagacious of all the plans which had been proposed to stop
this evil, was that set forth by Spurius Cassius, a noble patrician
now acting as consul for the third<span class="note">[l]</span>
time. In the year 268, he submitted to the burgesses<span class=
"note">[2]</span> a proposal to have the public land surveyed, that
portion belonging to the populus set aside and the remainder
divided among the plebeians or leased for the benefit<span class=
"note">[3]</span> of the public treasury.</p>

<p>He thus attempted to wrest from the senate the control of the
public land and, with the aid of the Latini and the plebeians, to
put an end to the system of occupation.<span class=
"note">[4]</span> The lands which he proposed to divide were solely
those which the state had acquired through conquest since the
general assignment by king Servius, and which it still
retained.<span class="note">[5]</span> This was the first measure
by which it was proposed to disturb the possessors in their
peaceful occupation of the state lands, and, according to Livy,
such a measure had never been proposed from then to the time in
which he was writing, under Augustus, without exciting the greatest
disturbance.<span class="note">[6]</span> Cassius might well
suppose that his personal distinction and the equity and wisdom of
the measure would carry it through, even amidst the storm of
opposition to which it was subjected. Like many other reformers
equally well meaning, he was mistaken.</p>

<p>The citizens who occupied this land had grown rich by reason of
its possessions. Some of them received it as an inheritance, and
doubtless looked upon it as their property as much as the <i>Ager
Romanus</i>. These to a man opposed the bill. The patricians arose
en masse. The rich plebeians, the aristocracy of wealth, took part
with them. Even the commons were dissatisfied because Spurius
Cassius proposed in accordance with federal rights and equity to
bestow a portion of the land upon the Latini and Hernici, their
confederates and allies.<span class="note">[7]</span> The bill
proposed by Cassius, together with such provisions as were
necessary, became a law, according to Niebuhr,<span class=
"note">[8]</span> because the tribunes had no power to bring
forward a law of any kind before the plebeian tribes obtained a
voice in the legislature by the enactment of the Publilian law in
472 B.C.; so that when they afterwards made use of the agrarian law
to excite the public passions it must have been one previously
enacted but dishonestly set aside and, in Dionysius' account, this
is the form which the commotion occasioned by it takes.<span class=
"note">[9]</span> Though this is doubtless true, yet the law, by
reason of the combined opposition, became a dead letter and the
people who would have been most benefited by its enforcement joined
with Cassius' enemies at the expiration of his term of office to
condemn him to death. In this way does ignorance commonly reward
its benefactors. This agitation aroused by Cassius, stirred the
Roman Commonwealth, now more than twenty years old, to its very
foundations, but it had no immediate effect upon the <i>ager
publicus</i>. The rich patrician together with the few plebeians
who had wealth enough to farm this land, still held undisputed
possession. The poor plebeian still continued to shed his blood on
the battle field to add to Roman territory, but no foot of it did
he obtain. Wealth centralized. Pauperism increased.</p>

<h4>SEC. <a name="II6">6.</a>&mdash;AGRARIAN MOVEMENTS BETWEEN 486
AND 367.</h4>

<br />
<p>Modern historians who have written upon the Roman Republic have,
so far as I know, passed immediately from the consideration of the
<i>Lex Cassia</i> to the law of Licinius Stolo. Meanwhile more than
a century had passed away. Cassius died in 485, Licinius Stolo
proposed his law in 376. During this century which had beheld the
organization of the republic and the growth, by tardy processes, of
the great plebeian body many agrarian laws were proposed and
numerous divisions of the public land took place. Both Dionysius
and Livy mention them. The poor success of the proposition of
Cassius and the evil consequences to himself in no way checked the
zeal of the tribunes. Propositions of agrarian laws followed one
another with wonderful rapidity. Livy enumerates these
propositions, but almost wholly without detail and without comments
upon their tendencies or points of difference from one another or
from the law of Cassius. As this law failed of its object by being
disregarded, we may safely conclude that the most of these
propositions were but a reproduction of the law of Cassius.</p>

<p>In 484, and again in 483, the tribune proposed agrarian laws but
what their nature was, Livy, who records them, does not tell us.
From some vague assertions which he makes we may conclude that the
point of the law was well known, and was but a repetition of that
of Cassius.<span class="note">[1]</span> The consul Caeso Fabius,
in 484, and his brother Marcus in the following year, secured the
opposition of the senate and succeeded in defeating their laws.</p>

<p>Livy (II, 42,) mentions very briefly a new proposition brought
forward by Spurius Licinius in 482. Here we are able to complete
his account by reference to Dionysius,<span class="note">[2]</span>
who says that, in 483, a tribune named Caius Maenius had proposed
an agrarian law and declared that he would oppose every levy of
troops until the senate should execute the law ordaining the
creation of decemvirs to determine the boundaries of the domain
land and, in fine, forbid the enrolment of citizens. The senate was
able through the consuls, Marcus Fabius and Valerius, the ancient
colleague of Cassius, to invent a means of avoiding this
difficulty. The authority of the tribunes by the old Roman
law,<span class="note">[3]</span> did not reach without the walls
of the city, while that of the consuls was everywhere equal and
only bounded by the limits of the Roman world. They moved their
curule chairs and other insignia of their authority without the
city walls and proceeded with the enrolments. All who refused to
enroll were treated as enemies<span class="note">[4]</span> of the
republic. Those who were proprietors had their property
confiscated, their trees cut down, and their houses burned. Those
who were merely farmers saw themselves bereft of their
farm-implements, their oxen and all things necessary for the
cultivation of the soil. The resistance of the tribunes was
powerless against this systematic oppression on the part of the
patricians; the agrarian<span class="note">[5]</span> law failed
and the enrolment progressed.</p>

<p>There is some difficulty in determining the facts of the law
proposed by Spurius Licinius<span class="note">[6]</span> of which
Livy speaks. Dionysius calls this tribune, not Licinius but
&Sigma;&pi;&upsilon;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;
&Sigma;&iota;&kappa;&iota;&lambda;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf; (Spurios
Sikilios). The Latin translation of Dionysius has the name Icilius
and this has been the name adopted by Sigonius and other
historians. Livy tells us that the Icilian family was at all times
hostile to the patricians and mentions many tribunes by this name
who were staunch defenders of the commons. In accepting this
correction, therefore, it is not necessary to confound this Icilius
with the one who proposed the partition of the Aventine among the
plebeians. Icilius, according to both Livy and Dionysius,<span
class="note">[7]</span> made the same demand as the previous
tribunes, <i>i.e.,</i> that the decemvirs should be nominated for
the survey and distribution of the domain lands, according to
previous enactment. He further declared that he would oppose every
decree of the senate either for war or the administration of the
interior until the adoption and execution of his measures. Again
the senate avoided the difficulty and escaped, by a trick, the
execution of the law. Appius Claudius, according to Dionysius,<span
class="note">[8]</span> advised the senate to search within the
tribunate for a remedy against itself, and to bribe a number of the
colleagues of Icilius to oppose his measure. This political perfidy
was adopted by the senate with the desired effect. Icilius
persisted in his proposition and declared he would rather see the
Etruscans masters of Rome than to suffer for a longer time the
usurpation of the domain lands on the part of the possessors.<span
class="note">[9]</span></p>

<p>This somewhat circumstantial account has revealed to us that at
this time it took a majority of the tribunes to veto an act of
their colleague. At the time of the Gracchi the veto of a single
tribune was sufficient to hinder the passage of a law, and Tiberius
was for a long time thus checked by his colleague, Octavius. Then
the tribunician college consisted of ten members, and it would be
no very difficult thing to detach one of the number either by
corruption or jealousy. But it is evident that, at the time we are
considering, it took a majority of the tribunes to veto an act of a
colleague; moreover, the college consisted of five members. This
latter fact is seen in the statement of Livy,<span class=
"note">[10]</span> when he mentions the opposition which four of
the tribunes offered to their colleague, Pontificius, in 480. In
this same case he attributes to Appius Claudius the conduct which
Dionysius attributed to him in the previous year. But he causes
Appius to state, in his speech favoring the corruption of certain
tribunes, "that the veto of one tribune would be sufficient to
defeat all the others."<span class="note">[11]</span> This is
contrary to the statement of Dionysius<span class=
"note">[12]</span> and would seem improbable, for, if the
opposition of one tribune was sufficient, the patricians would not
have deemed it necessary to purchase four. That would be contrary
to political methods.</p>

<p>Of the two propositions of the tribunes, Icilius, in 482, and
Pontificius, in 480, the results were the same. The opposition of
their colleagues defeated them. But this persistent opposition
rather than crushing seemed to stir up renewed attacks. We have
seen the tribunes, Menius, Icilius, and Pontificius, successively
fail. The next movement was led by a member of the aristocracy,
Fabius Caeso,<span class="note">[13]</span> consul for the third
time in 477. He undertook to remove from the hands of the tribunes
the terrible arm of agrarian agitation which they wielded
constantly against the patricians, by causing the patricians
themselves to distribute the domain lands equally among the
plebeians, saying: "that those<span class="note">[14]</span>
persons ought to have the lands by whose blood and sweat they had
been gained." His proposition was rejected with scorn by the
patricians, and this attempt at reconciliation failed as all the
attempts of the tribunes had. The war with Vaii which, according to
Livy, now took place hindered for a while any agrarian movements;
but, in 474, the tribunes Gaius Considius and Titus Genucius made a
fruitless attempt at distribution, and, in 472, Dionysius speaks of
a bill brought forward by Cn. Genucius which is probably the same
bill.</p>

<p>In 468, the two consuls, Valerius and Aemilius, faithfully
supported the tribunes in their demand<span class=
"note">[15]</span> for an agrarian law. The latter seems to have
supported the tribunes because he was angry that the senate had
refused to his father the honor of a triumph; Valerius, because he
wished to conciliate the people for having taken part in the
condemnation of Cassius.</p>

<p>Dionysius, according to his custom, takes advantage of the
occasion to write several long speeches here, and one of them is
valuable to us. He causes the father of Aemilius to set forth in a
formal speech the true character of the agrarian laws and the right
of the state to again assume the lands which had been taken
possession of. He further says: "that it is a wise policy<span
class="note">[16]</span> to proceed to the division of the lands in
order to diminish the constantly increasing number of the poor, to
insure a far greater number of citizens for the defense of the
country, to encourage marriages, and, in consequence, to increase
the number of children and defenders of the republic." We see in
this speech the real purpose, the germ, of all the ideas which
Licinius Stolo, the Gracchi, and even C&aelig;sar, strove to carry
out. But the Roman aristocracy was too blind to comprehend these
words of wisdom. All these propositions were either defeated or
eluded.</p>

<p><i>Lex Icilia.</i> In the year 454,<span class=
"note">[17]</span> Lucius Icilius, one of the tribunes for that
year, brought forward a bill that the Aventine hill should be
conveyed to the plebeians as their personal and especial
property.<span class="note">[18]</span> This hill had been the
earliest home of the plebeians, yet they had been surrounded by the
lots and fields of the patricians. That part of the hill which was
still in their possession was now demanded for the plebeians. It
was a small thing for the higher order to yield this much, as the
Aventine stood beyond the Pomoerium,<span class="note">[19]</span>
the hallowed boundary of the city, and, at best, could not have had
an area of more than one-fourth of a square mile, and this chiefly
woodland. The consuls, accordingly, made no hesitation about
presenting the bill to the senate before whom Icilius was admitted
to speak in its behalf. The bill was accepted by the senate and
afterwards confirmed by the Centuries.<span class=
"note">[20]</span> The law provided,&mdash;"that all the ground
which has been justly acquired by any persons shall continue in the
possession of the owners, but that such part of it as may have been
usurped by force or fraud by any persons and built upon, shall be
given to the people; those persons being repaid the expenses of
such buildings by the estimation of umpires to be appointed for
that purpose, and that all the rest of the ground belonging to the
public, be divided among the people, they paying no consideration
for the same."<span class="note">[21]</span> When this was done the
plebeians took possession of the hill with solemn ceremonies. This
hill did not furnish homes for all the plebeians, as some have
held; nor, indeed, did they wish to leave their present settlements
in town or country to remove to the Aventine. Plebeians were
already established in almost all parts of the city and held, as
vassals of the patricians, considerable portions of Roman
territory. This little hill could never have furnished<span class=
"note">[22]</span> homes of any sort to the whole plebeian
population. What it did do was to furnish to the plebeians a
trysting place in time of strife with their patrician neighbors,
where they could meet, apart and secure from interruption, to
devise means for resisting the encroachments of the patricians and
to further establish their rights as Roman citizens. Thus a step
toward their complete emancipation was taken. For a moment the
people were soothed and satisfied by their success, but soon they
began to clamor for more complete, more radical, more general laws.
An attempt seems to have been made in 453 to extend the application
of the <i>lex Icilia</i> to the <i>ager publicus,</i><span class=
"note">[23]</span> in general, but nothing came of it. In 440, the
tribune, Petilius, proposed an agrarian law. What its conditions
were Livy has not informed us, but has contented himself with
saying that "Petilius made a useless attempt to bring before the
senate a law for the division of the domain lands."<span class=
"note">[24]</span> The consuls strenuously opposed him and his
effort came to naught.</p>

<p>In our review of the agrarian agitation we must mention the
forceless and insignificant attempt made by the son of Spurius
Melius, in 434. Again, in 422, we find that other attempts were
made which availed nothing. Yet the tribunes who attempted thus to
gain the good will of the people set forth clearly the object which
they had in view in bringing forward an agrarian bill. Says Livy;
"They held out the hope to the people of a division of the public
land, the establishment of colonies, the levying of a
<i>vectigal</i> upon the possessors, which <i>vectigal</i> was to
be used<span class="note">[25]</span> in paying the soldiers."</p>

<p>In the year 419, and again in 418, unavailing attempts were made
for the division of lands among the plebeians. Spurius Maecilius
and Spurius Metilius, the tribunes<span class="note">[26]</span>for
the year 412, proposed to give to the people, in equal lots, the
conquered lands. The patricians ridiculed this law, stating that
Rome itself was founded upon conquered soil and did not possess a
single acre of land that had not been taken by force of arms, and
that the people held nothing save that which had been assigned by
the republic. The object, then, of the tribunes was to distribute
the fortunes of the entire state. Such vapid foolishness as this
failed not of the effect which the patricians aimed at. Appius
Claudius counselled the adoption of the excellent means invented by
his grandfather. Six tribunes were bought over by the caresses,
flatteries, and money of the patricians and opposed their vetoes to
their colleagues who were thus compelled to retire.<span class=
"note">[27]</span></p>

<p>In the following year, 411, Lucius Sextius, in no way
discouraged by the ill success of his predecessors, proposed the
establishment of a colony at Bolae, a town in the country of the
Volscians, which had been recently conquered. The patricians<span
class="note">[28]</span> opposed this by the same method which they
had adopted in the preceding case, the veto by tribunes. Livy
criticises the impolitic opposition of the patricians in these
words: "This was a most seasonable time, after the punishment of
the mutiny, that the division of the territory of Bolae should be
presented as a soother to their minds; by which proceeding they
would have diminished their eagerness for an agrarian law, which
tended to expel the patricians from the public land unjustly
possessed by them. Then this very indignity exasperated their
minds, that the nobility persisted not only in retaining the public
lands, which they got possession of by force, but would not even
grant to the commons the unoccupied land lately taken from the
enemy, and which would, like the rest,<span class=
"note">[29]</span> soon become the prey of the few."</p>

<p>In 409, Icilius, without doubt a member of that plebeian family
which had furnished so many stout defenders of the liberties of the
people, was elected tribune of the people and brought forward an
agrarian bill, but a plague broke out and hindered any further
action. In 407, the tribune, Menius, introduced an agrarian bill
and declared that he would oppose the levies until the persons who
unjustly held the public domains consented to a division. A war
broke out and agrarian legislation was drowned amid the din of
arms. Some years now elapsed without the mention of any agrarian
laws. The siege of Veii commenced in 406 and lasted for six years,
during which time military law was established, giving occupation
and some sort of satisfaction to the plebeians. In 397, an agrarian
movement was set on foot, but the plebeians were partially
satisfied by being allowed to elect one of their number as
<i>tribunus consularis</i> for the following year, thus obtaining a
little honor but no land. After the conquest of Veii, there was a
movement on the part of the plebeians to remove from Rome and
settle upon the confiscated territory of the Veians; this was only
staid by concessions on the part of the patricians. A decree of the
senate was passed,&mdash;"that seven jugera, a man, of Vientian
territory, should be distributed to the commons and not only to the
fathers of families, but also that all persons in their house in
the state of freedom should be considered, and that they might be
willing to rear up children<span class="note">[30]</span> with that
prospect." In 384, six years after the conquest of Rome by the
Gauls, the tribunes of the year proposed a law for the division of
the Pomptine territory (<i>Pomptinus Ager</i>) among the plebeians.
The time was not a favorable one for the agitation of the people,
as they were busy with the reconstruction of their houses laid
waste by the Gauls, and the movement came to nothing. The tribune,
Lucius Licinius, in 383, revived this movement but it was not
successfully carried till the year 379, when the senate, well
disposed towards the commons by reason of the conquest of the
Volscians, decreed the nomination of five commissioners to divide
the Pomptine territory<span class="note">[31]</span> among the
plebs. This was a new victory for the people and must have inspired
them with the hope of one day obtaining in full their rights in the
public domains.</p>

<p>We have now passed in review the agrarian laws proposed and, in
some cases, enacted between the years 485 and 376, <i>i.e.</i>
between the <i>lex Cassia</i> and the <i>lex Licinia</i>, which the
greater part of the historians have neglected. We have now come to
the propositions of that illustrious plebeian whose laws, whose
character, and whose object have been so diversely appreciated by
all those persons who have studied in any way the constitutional
history of Rome. We wish to enter into a detailed examination of
the <i>lex Licinia</i>, but before so doing have deemed it
expedient to thus pass in review the agrarian agitations. The
result of this work has, we trust, been a better understanding of
the real tendency, the true purpose, of the law which is now to
absorb our attention. It was no innovation, as some writers of the
day assert, but in reality confined itself to the well beaten track
of its predecessors, striving only to make their attainments more
general, more substantial and more complete.</p>

<h4><a name="II7">SEC. 7.</a>&mdash;LEX LICINIA.</h4>

<br />
<p>Party lines were, at the time of the enactment of the Licinian
Law, strongly marked in Rome. One of the tribunes chosen after the
return of the plebeians from Mons Sacer was a Licinius. The first
military tribune with consular power elected from the plebeians was
another Licinius Calvus. The third great man of this distinguished
family was Caius Licinius Calvus Stolo, who, in the prime of life
and popularity, was chosen among the tribunes of the plebs for the
seventh year following the death of Manlius the Patrician. Another
plebeian, Lucius Sextius by name, was chosen tribune at the same
time. If not already, he soon became the tried friend of Licinius.
Sextius was the younger but not the less earnest of the two. Both
belonged to that portion of the plebeians supposed to have been
latterly connected with the liberal patricians. The more
influential and by far the more reputable members of the lower
estate were numbered in this party. Opposed to it were two other
parties of plebeians. One consisted of the few who, rising to
wealth or rank, cast off the bonds uniting them to the lower
estate. They preferred to be upstarts among patricians rather than
leaders among plebeians. As a matter of course, they became the
parasites of the illiberal patricians. To the same body was
attached another plebeian party. This was formed of the inferior
classes belonging to the lower estate. These inferior plebeians
were generally disregarded by the higher classes of their own
estate as well as by the patricians of both the liberal and
illiberal parties. They were the later comers, or the poor and
degraded among all. As such they had no other resource but to
depend on the largesses or the commissions of the most lordly of
the patricians. This division of the plebeians is a point to be
distinctly marked. While there were but two parties, that is the
liberal and the illiberal among the patricians, there were no less
than three among the plebeians. Only one of the three could be
called a plebeian party. That was the party containing the nerve
and sinew of the order, which united only with the liberal
patricians, and with them only on comparatively independent terms.
The other two parties were nothing but servile retainers of the
illiberal patricians.</p>

<p>It was to the real plebeian party that Licinius belonged, as
also did his colleague Sextius,<span class="note">[1]</span> by
birth. A tradition of no value represented the patrician and the
plebeian as being combined to support the same cause in consequence
of a whim of the wife and daughter through whom they were
connected. Some revolutions, it is true, are the effect of an
instant's passion or an hour's weakness. Nor can they then make use
of subsequent achievements to conceal the caprices or the
excitements in which they originated. But a change, attempted by
Licinius with the help of his father-in-law, his colleague, and a
few friends reached back one hundred years and more (B.C. 486) to
the law of the martyred Cassius, and forward to the end of the
Commonwealth. It opened new honors as well as fresh resources to
the plebeians.</p>

<p>Probably the tribune was raised to his office because he had
shown the determination to use its powers for the good of his order
and of his country. Licinius and Sextius together brought forward
the three bills bearing the name of Licinius as their author. One,
says the historian, ran concerning debts. It provided that, the
interest already<span class="note">[2]</span> paid being deducted
from the principal, the remainder should be discharged in equal
installments within three years. The statutes against excessive
rates of interest, as well as those against arbitrary measures of
exacting the principal of a debt, had utterly failed. It was plain,
therefore, to any one who thought upon the matter,&mdash;in which
effort of thought the power of all reformers begins,&mdash;that the
step to prevent the sacrifice of the debtor to the creditor was
still to be taken. Many of the creditors themselves would have
acknowledged that this was desirable. The next bill of the three
related to the public lands. It prohibited any one from occupying
more than five hundred jugera, about 300 acres; at the same time it
reclaimed all above that limit from the present occupiers, with the
object of making suitable apportionments among the people<span
class="note">[3]</span> at large. Two further clauses followed, one
ordering that a certain number of freemen should be employed on
every estate; another forbidding any single citizen<span class=
"note">[4]</span> to send out more than a hundred of the larger, or
five hundred of the smaller cattle to graze upon the public
pastures. These latter details are important, not so much in
relation to the bill itself as to the simultaneous increase of
wealth and slavery which they plainly signify. As the first bill
undertook to prohibit the bondage springing from too much poverty,
so the second aimed at preventing the oppression springing from too
great opulence. A third bill declared the office of military
tribune with consular power to be at an end. In its place the
consulate was restored with full<span class="note">[5]</span>
provision that one of the two consuls should be taken from the
plebeians. The argument produced in favor of this bill appears to
have been the urgent want of the plebeians to possess a greater
share in the government than was vested in their tribunes, aediles,
and quaestors. Otherwise, said Licinius and his colleague, there
will be no security that our debts will be settled or that our
lands will be obtained.<span class="note">[6]</span> It would be
difficult to frame three bills, even in our time, reaching to a
further, or fulfilling a larger reform. "Everything was pointed
against the power of the patricians<span class="note">[7]</span> in
order to provide for the comfort of the plebeians." This to a
certain degree was true. It was chiefly from the patrician that the
bill concerning debts detracted the usurious gains which had been
counted upon. It was chiefly from him that the lands indicated in
the second bill were to be withdrawn. It was altogether from him
that the honors of the consulship were to be derogated. On the
other hand the plebeians, save the few proprietors and creditors
among them, gained by every measure that had been proposed. The
poor man saw himself snatched from bondage and endowed with an
estate. He who was above the reach of debt saw himself in the
highest office of the state. Plebeians with reason exulted.
Licinius evidently designed reuniting the divided members of the
plebeian body. Not one of them, whether rich or poor, but seems
called back by these bills to stand with his own order from that
time on. If this supposition was true, then Licinius was the
greatest leader whom the plebeians ever had up to the time of
C&aelig;sar. But<span class="note">[8]</span> from the first he was
disappointed. The plebeians who most wanted relief cared so little
for having the consulship opened to the richer men of their estate
that they would readily have dropped the bill concerning it, lest a
demand should endanger their own desires. In the same temper the
more eminent men of the order, themselves among the creditors of
the poor and the tenants of the domain, would have quashed the
proceedings of the tribunes respecting the discharge of debt and
the distribution of land, so that they carried the third bill only,
which would make them consuls without disturbing their possessions.
While the plebeians continued severed from one another, the
patricians drew together in resistance to the bills. Licinius stood
forth demanding, at once, all that it had cost his predecessors
their utmost energy to demand, singly and at long intervals, from
the patricians. Nothing was to be done but to unite in overwhelming
him and his supporters. "Great things were those that he claimed
and not to be secured without the greatest contention."<span class=
"note">[9]</span> The very comprehensiveness of his measures proved
the safeguard of Licinius. Had he preferred but one of these
demands, he would have been unhesitatingly opposed by the great
majority of the patricians. On the other hand he would have had
comparatively doubtful support from the plebs. If the interests of
the poorer plebeians alone had been consulted, they would not have
been much more active or able in backing their tribunes, while the
richer men would have gone over in a body to the other side with
the public tenants and the private creditors among the patricians.
Or, supposing the case reversed and the bill relating to the
consulship brought forward alone, the debtors and the homeless
citizens would have given the bill too little help with hands or
hearts to secure its passage as a law. The great encouragement
therefore to Licinius and Sextius must have been their conviction
that they had devised their reform on a sufficiently expanded
scale. As soon as the bills were brought forward every one of their
eight colleagues vetoed their reading. Nothing could be done by the
two tribunes except to be resolute and watch for an opportunity for
retaliation. At the election of the military tribunes during that
year, Licinius and Sextius interposed<span class="note">[10]</span>
their vetoes and prevented a vote being taken. No magistrates could
remain in office after their terms expired, whether there were any
successors elected or not to come after them. The commonwealth
remained without any military tribunes or consuls at its head,
although the vacant places were finally filled by one
<i>interrex</i> after another, appointed by the senate to keep up
the name of government and to hold the elections the moment the
tribunes withdrew their vetoes, or left their office. At the close
of the year Licinius and Sextius were both re-elected but with
colleagues on the side of their antagonists. Some time afterwards
it became necessary to let the other elections proceed. War was
threatening,<span class="note">[11]</span> and in order to go to
the assistance of their allies Licinius and Sextius withdrew their
vetoes and ceased their opposition for a time. Six military
tribunes were chosen, three from the liberal and three from the
illiberal patricians. The liberals doubtless received all the votes
of the plebeians as they had no candidates. They had in all
probability abstained from running for an office, bills for the
abolition of which were held in abeyance. They showed increasing
inclination to sustain Licinius and his colleague, both by
re-electing them year after year and by at length choosing three
other tribunes with them in favor of the bills. The prospects of
the measure were further brightened by the election of Fabius
Ambustus, the father-in-law of Licinius and his zealous supporter,
to the military<span class="note">[12]</span> tribunate. This seems
to have been the seventh year following the proposal of the bills.
This can not be definitely determined, however. During this long
period of struggle, Licinius had learned something. It was
constantly repeated<span class="note">[13]</span> in his hearing
that not a plebeian in the whole estate was fit to take the part in
the auspices and the religious ceremonies incumbent upon the
consuls. The same objections had overborne the exertions of Caius
Canuleius three-quarters of a century before. Licinius saw that the
only way to defeat this argument was by opening to the plebeians
the honorable office of <i>duumvirs</i>, whose duty and privilege
it was<span class="note">[14]</span> to consult the Sibyline books
for the instruction of the people in every season of doubt and
peril. They were, moreover, the presiding officers of the festival
of Apollo, to whose inspirations the holy books of the Sibyl were
ascribed, and were looked up to with honor and respect. This he did
by setting forth an additional bill, proposing the election of
<i>decemvirs</i>.<span class="note">[15]</span> The passage of this
bill would forever put to rest one question at least. Could he be a
decemvir, he could also be a consul. This bill was joined to the
other three which were biding their time. The strife went on. The
opposing tribunes interposed their vetoes. Finally it seems that
all the offices of tribune were filled with partisans of Licinius,
and the bills were likely to pass when Camillus, the dictator,
swelling with wrath against bills, tribes and tribunes,<span class=
"note">[16]</span> came forward into the forum. He commanded the
tribunes to see to it that the tribes cast no more votes. But on
the contrary they ordered the people to continue as they had begun.
Camillus ordered his lictors to break up the assembly and proclaim
that if a man lingered in the forum, the dictator would call out
every man fit for service and march from Rome. The tribunes ordered
resistance and declared that if the dictator did not instantly
recall his lictors and retract his proclamation, they, the
tribunes, would, according to their right, subject him to a fine
five times larger than the highest rate of the census, as soon as
his dictatorship expired. This was no idle threat, and Camillus
retreated so fairly beaten as to abdicate immediately under the
pretense of faulty auspices.<span class="note">[17]</span> The
plebeians adjourned satisfied with their day's victory. But before
they could be again convened some influence was brought to bear
upon them so that when the four bills were presented only the two
concerning land and debts were accepted. This was nothing less than
a fine piece of engineering on the part of the patricians to defeat
the whole movement and could have resulted in nothing less.
Licinius was disappointed but not confounded. With a sneer at the
selfishness as well as the blindness of those who had voted only
for what they themselves most wanted he bade them take heed that
they could not eat if they would not drink.<span class=
"note">[18]</span> He refused to separate the bills. The consent to
their division would have been equivalent to consenting to the
division of the plebeians. His resolution carried the day. The
liberal patricians as well as the plebeians rallied to his support.
A moderate patrician, a relation of Licinius, was appointed
dictator, and a member of the same house was chosen master of the
horse. These events prove that the liberal patricians were in the
majority. Licinius and Sextius were re-elected for the tenth time,
A.C. 366, thus proving that the plebeians had decided to eat and
drink.<span class="note">[19]</span></p>

<p>The fourth bill, concerning the decemvirs was almost instantly
laid before the tribes and carried through them. It was accepted by
the higher assemblies and thus became a law. It is not evident why
this bill was separated from the others, especially when Licinius
had declared that they should not be separated. Possibly it was to
smooth the way for the other three more weighty ones, especially
the bill concerning the consulship.<span class="note">[20]</span>
There seems to have been an interruption here caused by an invasion
of the Gauls.<span class="note">[21]</span> As soon as this was
over the struggle began again. The tribes assembled. "Will you have
our bills?" asked Licinius and Sextius for the last time. "We
will," was the reply. It was amid more violent conflicts, however,
than had yet arisen that the bills became laws<span class=
"note">[22]</span> at last.</p>

<p>It takes all the subsequent history of Rome to measure the
consequences of the Revolution achieved by Licinius and Sextius;
but the immediate working of their laws could have been nothing but
a disappointment to their originators and upholders. We can tell
little or nothing about the regard paid to the <i>decemvirs</i>.
The priestly robes must have seemed an unprecedented honor to the
plebeian. For some ten years the law regarding the consulship was
observed, after which time it was occasionally<span class=
"note">[23]</span> violated, but can still be called a success. The
laws<span class="note">[24]</span> of relief, as may be supposed of
all such sumptuary enactments, were violated from the first. No
general recovery of the public land from those occupying more than
five hundred<span class="note">[25]</span> jugera ever took place.
Consequently there was no general division of land among the
lackland class. Conflicting claims and jealousy on the part of the
poor must have done much to embarrass and prevent the execution of
the law. No system of land survey to distinguish between <i>ager
publicus</i> and <i>ager privatus</i> existed. Licinius Stolo
himself was afterwards convicted of violating his own law.<span
class="note">[26]</span> The law respecting debts met with much the
same obstacles. The causes of embarrassment and poverty being much
the same and undisturbed, soon reproduced the effects which no
reduction of interest or installment of principal could effectually
remove. It is not our intention, however, to express any doubt that
the enactments of Licinius, such as they were, might and did
benefit the small farmer and the day laborer.<span class=
"note">[27]</span> Many were benefited. In the period immediately
following the passing of the law, the authorities watched with some
interest and strictness over the observance of its rules and
frequently condemned the possessors of large herds and occupiers of
public domain to heavy fines.<span class="note">[28]</span> But in
the main the rich still grew richer and the poor and mean, poorer
and more contemptible. Such was ever the liberty of the Roman. For
the mean and the poor there was no means of retrieving their
poverty and degradation.</p>

<p>These laws, then, had little or no effect upon the domain
question or the re-distribution of land. They did not fulfil the
evident expectation of their author in uniting the plebeians into
one political body. This was impossible. What they did do was to
break up and practically abolish the patriciate.<span class=
"note">[29]</span> Henceforth were the Roman people divided into
rich and poor only.</p>

<h4><a name="II8">SEC. VIII.</a>&mdash;AGRARIAN MOVEMENTS BETWEEN
367 AND 133.</h4>

<br />
<p>The first agrarian movement after the enactment of lex Licinia
took place in the year 338, after the battle of Veseris in which
the Latini and their allies were completely conquered. According to
Livy,<span class="note">[1]</span> the several peoples engaged in
this rebellion were mulcted of a part of their land which was
divided among the plebeians. Each plebeian receiving an allotment
in the territory of the Latini had 2 jugera assigned him, while
those in Privernum received 2&frac34;, and those in Falernian
territory received 3 jugera each (p. 252). This distribution of
domain lands seems to have been spontaneous on the part of the
senate. But it led to grave consequences as the Latini, indignant
at their being despoiled of their lands, resorted again to arms.
The plebeians, moreover, were roused to the verge of rebellion by
the consul Aemilius who had been alienated from the patricians by
their refusing him a triumph, and now strove to ingratiate himself
with the commons by making them dissatisfied with their meagre
allotments. The law, however, was carried into execution, and thus
showed that the senate acquiesced in and even initiated laws when
they did not in any way interfere with their possession, but
referred only to territory which had just been conquered.</p>

<p><i>Agrarian Law of Curius.</i> Beyond the distribution of the
<i>ager publicus</i> which formed the basis of the numerous
colonies of this period and which will be considered in their
proper place, the next agrarian movement was that of Curius
Dentatus. At the close of the third Samnite War the people were in
great distress, as agricultural pursuits had been greatly
interrupted by continued warfare. Now there seemed to be a chance
of remedying this. Large tracts of land had been taken from the
Samnites and Sabines, and it was now at the disposal of the
Roman<span class="note">[2]</span> state for purposes of
colonization and division among the impoverished citizens. In the
year 287,<span class="note">[3]</span> a bill was introduced by
Manius Curius Dentatus, the plebeian consul for this year, and hero
of the third Samnite War. He proposed giving to the citizens
assignments of land in the Sabine country of seven jugera<span
class="note">[4]</span> each. It is certain that this bill met with
great opposition but we have not been informed as to the
causes.<span class="note">[5]</span> It is safe to conclude,
however, that the question was whether assignments of land with
full right of property should be made in districts which the great
land-owners wished to keep open for occupation in order that they
might pasture herds thereon. The senate and the nobility so
bitterly opposed the plan that the plebeians despairing of success,
withdrew to the Janiculum and only on account of threatening war
did they consent to the proposals of Quintus Hortensius.<span
class="note">[6]</span> By this move the <i>lex Hortensia</i><span
class="note">[7]</span> was passed and, doubtless, the <i>agraria
lex</i> was enacted at the same time although nothing definite is
known concerning this point. The people must have been pacified by
some other means than the mere granting of more political power.
Nothing less than a share of the conquered territory would have
satisfied them or induced them to return and again take up the
burden of war.</p>

<p><i>Lex Flaminia.</i> Fifty four years after the enactment of the
law of Curius Dentatus, in the year 232, the tribune Caius
Flaminius,<span class="note">[8]</span> the man who afterwards was
consul and fell in the bloody battle of lake Trasimenus, brought
forward and carried a law for the distribution of the <i>Gallicus
Ager</i><span class="note">[9]</span> among the plebeians. This
territory<span class="note">[10]</span> had been taken from the
Galli Semnones fifty-one years before and was now occupied as
pasture land by some large Roman families. This territory lay north
of Picenum and extended as far as Ariminum<span class=
"note">[11]</span>(Rimini.) This was an excellent opportunity for
awarding lands to Roman veterans for military service, and thus to
establish a large number of small farms, rather than to leave the
land in the possession of the rich who resided in Rome and,
consequently, formed no frontier protection against the inroads of
barbarians from the north. By alloting the land, the Latin race and
Latin tongue would help to Romanize territory already conquered by
Roman arms. The only thing opposed to this was the possession of
the land by the aristocracy. But they had no legal claim to the
land and could be dispossessed without any indemnification. The
senate opposed this measure to the utmost of their ability and,
after all other means had failed, threatened to send an army
against the tribune if he urged his bill through the tribes. They
further induced his father to make use of his <i>potestas</i> in
restraining his son.<span class="note">[12]</span> When Flaminius
was bringing up the bill for decision he was arrested by his
father. "Come down, I bid thee," said the father. And the son
humbled "by private authority,"<span class="note">[13]</span>
obeyed. It finally became necessary for the plebeians to take their
stand on the formal constitutional law and to cause the <i>agraria
lex</i> to be passed by a vote of the assembly of the tribes
without a previous resolution or subsequent approbation of the
senate.<span class="note">[14]</span> Polybius dates a change for
the worse in the Roman constitution from this time.<span class=
"note">[15]</span> The relief of the plebeians was further promoted
by the foundation<span class="note">[16]</span> of new
colonies.</p>

<p>In the year 200, after Scipio returned as conqueror of Carthage,
the senate decreed that he should be assigned some lands for his
soldiers, but Livy does not tell us where they were to be assigned;
whether they were to be a part of the ancient <i>ager publicus</i>
or of the territory of Carthage, Sicily, or Campania, <i>i.e.</i>
the new conquests of Rome. He merely says that for each year of
service in Spain or Africa the soldiers were to receive two jugera
each, and that<span class="note">[17]</span> the distributions
should be made by the <i>decenvirs</i>. In spite of the
insufficiency of these details the passage reveals to us two
important facts:</p>

<p>1. Decemvirs as well as triumvirs were at times appointed to
make distributions of domain lands in accordance with the
provisions of an agrarian law.</p>

<p>2. It reveals the profound modifications which Roman customs had
passed through. The riches which began at this time to flow into
Rome by reason of the many successful wars revolutionized the
economic conditions of the city. It is not necessary to see only a
proof of corruption in this tendency of all classes to grasp for
riches and to desire luxury and ease. We must also consider that
comfort was more accessible and that the price of everything,
especially of the necessaries of life, had increased. In
consequence of this it was difficult for soldiers to support
themselves with their pay. The presents of a few sesterces given
them as prize money in no way made sufficient recompense for all
the miseries and privations which they had passed through during
their long absence. Grants of land were the only means of
recompensing their military services. This is the first example
that we have found of soldiers being thus rewarded, and it
consequently initiated a custom which became most frequent
especially in the time of the empire. Upon the conquest of Italy
which followed the expedition of Pyrrhus, the Romans found
themselves led into a long series of foreign wars; Sicily furnished
the stepping-stone to Africa; Africa to Spain; all these countries
becoming Roman provinces. As soon as the second Punic war closed,
Hannibal formed an alliance with the king of Macedonia. A war-cloud
rose<span class="note">[18]</span> in the east. The &AElig;tolians
asked aid from Rome, and statesmen could foretell that it would be
impossible for Roman armies not to interfere between Greece and
Macedonia. But these countries had been from ancient times most
intimately connected with the orient, <i>i.e.</i>, Asia, where the
Seleucidae still ruled, so that a war with Greece, which was
inevitable, could not fail to bring on a war with the successors of
Alexander, and, these hostilities once engaged in, who could say
where these accidents of war would cease, or when Roman arms could
be laid aside? In this critical condition it was prudent to attach
the soldiers to the republic by bonds and interests the most
intimate, to make them proprietors and to assure subsistence to
their families during their long absence. These wars did not much
resemble those of the early republic which had for a theatre of war
the country in the immediate vicinity of Rome.</p>

<p>The senate continued to take the initiative in agrarian
movements. In 172, after the close of the wars against the
Ligurians and Gauls, we again see the senate spontaneously
decreeing a new division of the lands. A part of the territory of
Liguria and Cisalpine Gaul was confiscated and a <i>senatus
consultum</i> ordered a distribution of this land to the commons.
The praetor of the city A. Atilius, was authorized to appoint
<i>decemvirs</i>, whose names Livy gives, to assign ten jugera to
Roman citizens and three jugera to Latin<span class=
"note">[19]</span> allies. Thus the senate, with a newly-born
sagacity, rendered useless the demands of the tribune and
recognized the justice and the utility of the agrarian laws against
which it had so long protested. Indeed, it justified the
propositions of the first author of an agrarian law by admitting to
a share in the conquered lands the Latin allies who had so often
contributed to their growth. This is the last agrarian law which
Livy mentions. The Persian war broke out in this year, and an
account of it fills the remaining books of this author which have
come down to us. However, prior to the proposition of Tiberius
Gracchus, we find in Varro<span class="note">[20]</span> the
mention of a new assignment of land of seven jugera <i>viritim</i>,
made by a tribune named Licinius in the year 144; but the author
has given such a meagre mention of it that we are unable to
determine where these lands were located. If we join to these facts
the cession of public territories to the creditors of the state, in
200, we shall have mentioned all agrarian laws and distributions of
territory which took place before the <i>lex Sempronia
Tiberiana</i> in 133.</p>

<p><i>Condition of the Country at the time of the Gracchan
Rogations.</i> During the period between 367 and 133 we find no
record of serious disputes between the patricians and commons.
Indeed, the senate usually took the lead in popular measures; lands
were assigned without any demand on the part of the plebeians. We
must not be deceived by this seeming harmony. In the midst of this
apparent calm a radical change was taking place in Roman society.
It is necessary for us to understand this new condition of affairs
in the republic before it will be possible to comprehend the
rogations of the Gracchi.</p>

<p>One of the greatest dangers to the republic at this time reveals
itself in the claims<span class="note">[21]</span> of the Italians.
These people had poured out their blood for Rome; they had
contributed more than the Romans themselves to the accomplishing of
those rapid conquests which, after the subjugation of Italy,
quickly extended the power of Rome. In what way had they been
rewarded? After the terrible devastations which afflicted Italy in
the Hannibalic war had ceased, the Italian allies found themselves
ruined. Whilst Latium, which contained the principal part of the
old tribes of citizens, had suffered comparatively little, a large
portion of Samnium, Apulia, Campania, and more particularly of
Lucania and Bruttium, was almost depopulated; and the Romans in
punishing the unfaithful "allies" had acted with ruthless
cruelty.<span class="note">[22]</span> When at length peace was
concluded, large districts were uncultivated and uninhabited. This
territory, being either confiscated from the allies for taking part
with Hannibal, or deserted by the colonists, swelled the <i>ager
publicus</i> of Rome, and was either given to veterans<span class=
"note">[23]</span>or occupied by Roman capitalists, thus increasing
the revenues of a few nobles.</p>

<p>If a nation is in a healthful condition politically and
economically so that the restorative vigor of nature is not impeded
by bad restrictive laws, the devastations of land and losses of
human life are quickly repaired. We might the more especially have
expected this in a climate so genial and on a soil so fertile as
that of Italy. But Roman laws so restricted the right of buying and
selling land that in every Italian community none but members of
that community, or Roman citizens, could<span class=
"note">[24]</span> buy or inherit. This restriction upon free
competition, by giving the advantage to Roman citizens, was in
itself sufficient to ruin the prosperity of every Italian town.
This law operated continually and unobservedly and resulted in
placing,<span class="note">[25]</span> year by year, a still larger
quantity of the soil of Italy in the hands of the Roman
aristocracy. In order to palliate the evils of conquest or at least
to hide their conditions of servitude, the Romans had accorded to a
part of the Italians the title of allies, and to others the
privileges of <i>municipia</i>.<span class="note">[26]</span> These
privileges were combined in a very skillful manner in the interest
of Rome, but this skill did not hinder the people from perceiving
that they depended upon the mere wish of the conquerors and
consequently were not rights, but merely favors to be revoked at
will. The Latini, who had been the first people conquered by Rome
and who had almost always remained faithful, enjoyed under the name
of <i>jus Latii</i> considerable privileges. They held in
great<span class="note">[27]</span> part the civil and political
rights of Roman citizens. They were able by special services
individually to become Roman citizens and thus to obtain the full
<i>jus Romanum</i>. There were other peoples who, although
strangers to Latium, had been admitted, by reason of their
services<span class="note">[28]</span> to Rome, to participate in
the benefits of the <i>jus Latii</i>. The other peoples, admitted
merely to the <i>jus Italicum</i>, did not enjoy any of the civil
or political rights of Roman citizens, nor any of the privileges of
Latin<span class="note">[29]</span> allies; at best they kept some
souvenirs of their departed independence in their interior
administration, but otherwise were considered as subjects of Rome.
And yet it was for the aggrandizement of this city that they shed
their blood upon all the fields of battle which it pleased Rome to
choose; it was for the glory and extension of the Roman power that
they gained these conquests in which they had no share. Some who
had attempted to regain their independence were not even accorded
the humble privileges of the other people of Italy, but were
reduced to the state of prefectures. These were treated as
provinces and governed by prefects or proconsuls sent<span class=
"note">[30]</span> out from Rome. Such were Capua, Bruttium,
Lucania, the greater part of Samnium, and Cisalpine Gaul, which
country, indeed, was not even considered as a part of Italy. Those
who had submitted without resistance to the domination of the
Romans, and had rendered some services to them, had bestowed upon
them the title of <i>municipia</i>.<span class="note">[31]</span>
These <i>municipia</i> governed themselves and were divided into
two classes:</p>

<p>(1.) <i>Municipia sine suffragio</i>, for example, Caere and
Etruria, had only interior privileges; their inhabitants could not
vote at Rome and, consequently, could not<span class=
"note">[32]</span> participate in the exercise of sovereignty.</p>

<p>(2.) <i>Municipia cum suffragio</i> had, outside of their
political and civil rights, the important right of voting<span
class="note">[33]</span> at Rome. These citizens of villages had
then, as Cicero said of the citizens of Arpinum, two countries, one
<i>ex natura</i>, the other <i>ex jure</i>. Lastly, there were some
cities in the south of Italy, <i>i.e.</i> in Magna Graecia, that
had received<span class="note">[34]</span> the name of federated
cities. They did not appear to be subject to Rome; their
contingents of men and money were looked upon as voluntary<span
class="note">[35]</span> gifts; but, in reality, they were under
the domination of Rome, and had, at Rome, defenders or patrons
chosen because of their influence with the Roman citizens and
charged with maintaining their interests. Such was the system
adopted by Rome. It would have been easy for a person in the
compass of a few miles to find villages having the <i>jus
Latii</i>, others with simply the <i>jus Italicum</i>, colonies,
prefectures, municipia <i>cum</i> et <i>sine suffragio</i>. The
object of the Romans was evident. They planned to govern. Cities
alike in interests and patriotic motives were separated by this
diversity of rights and the jealousies and hatreds which resulted
from it. Concord, which was necessary to any united and general
insurrection, was rendered impossible between towns, some of which
were objects of envy, others, of pity. Their condition, moreover,
was such that all, even the most fortunate, had something to gain
by showing themselves faithful; and all, even the most wretched,
had something to fear if they did not prove tractable. These
Italians, with all the varied privileges and burdens enumerated
above, far outnumbered the Roman citizens.<span class=
"note">[36]</span> A comparison of the numbers of the census of 115
and that of 70 shows that the numbers of Italians and Romans
were<span class="note">[37]</span> as three to two. All these
Italians aspired to Roman citizenship, to enjoy the right to vote
to which some of their number had been admitted, and the struggle
which was sometime to end in their complete emancipation had
already commenced. During the first centuries of Roman history,
Rome was divided into two classes, patricians and plebeians. The
plebeians by heroic efforts had broken down the barriers that
separated them from the patricians. The privilege of intermarriage,
the possibility of obtaining the highest offices of the state, the
substitution of the <i>comitia tributa</i> for the other two
assemblies, had not made of Rome "an unbridled democracy," but all
these benefits obtained by tribunician agitation, all the
far-reaching advances gained by force of laws and not of arms, had
constituted at Rome a single people and created a true Roman
nation. There were now at Rome only rich and poor, nobles and
proletariat. With intelligence and ability a plebeian could aspire
to the magistracies and thence to the senate. Why should not the
Italians be allowed the same privilege? It was neither just nor
equitable nor even prudent to exclude them from an equality of
rights and the common exercise of civil<span class=
"note">[38]</span> and political liberty. The Gracchi were the
first to comprehend the changed state of affairs and the result of
Roman conquest and administration in Italy. Their demands in favor
of the Italians were profoundly politic. The Italians would have
demanded, with arms in their hands, that which the Gracchi asked
for them, had not this attempt been made. They failed; Fulvius<span
class="note">[39]</span> Flaccus, Marius,<span class=
"note">[40]</span> and Livius Drusus<span class="note">[41]</span>
failed in the same attempt, being opposed both by the nobility and
the plebs.</p>

<p>The agrarian laws, as we have seen, had been proposed by the
senate, in the period which we are considering. How was it then
that the Gracchi had been compelled to take the initiative and that
the senate had opposed them? This contradiction is more apparent
than real. It explains itself in great part by the following
considerations. Upon the breaking down of the aristocracy of birth,
the patriciate, the senate was made accessible to the plebeians who
had filled the curule magistracies and were possessed of 800,000
sesterces. Knights were also eligible to the senate to fill
vacancies, and it was this fact which caused the equestrian order
to be called <i>seminarium senatus</i>. For some time the new
nobles, in order to strengthen their victory and make it permanent,
had formed an alliance with the plebeians. For this reason were
made the concessions and distributions of land which the old
senators were unable to hinder. These concessions were the work of
the plebeians who had been admitted to the senate. But when their
position was assured and it was no longer necessary for them to
make concessions to the commons in order to sustain themselves,
they manifested the same passions that the patricians had shown
before them. Livy has expressed the situation very clearly: "These
noble plebeians had been initiated into the same mysteries, and
despised the people as soon as they themselves ceased to be
despised by the patricians."<span class="note">[42]</span> Thus,
then, the unity and fusion which had been established by the
tribunician laws disappeared and there again existed two peoples,
the rich and the poor.</p>

<p>If we examine into the elements of these two distinct
populations, separated by the pride of wealth and the misery and
degradation of poverty, we shall understand this. The new nobility
was made up partially of the descendants of the ancient patrician
<i>gentes</i> who had adapted themselves to the modifications and
transformations in society. Of these persons, some had adopted the
ideas of reform; they had flattered the lower classes in order to
obtain power; they profited by their consulships and their
prefectures to increase or at least conserve their fortunes. Others
having business capacity gave themselves up to gathering riches; to
usurious speculations which at this time held chief place among the
Romans. Even Cato was a usurer and recommended usury as a means of
acquiring wealth. Or they engaged in vast speculations in land,
commerce, and slaves, as Crassus did a little later. The first
mentioned class was the least numerous. To those nobles who gave
their attention to money-getting must be added those plebeians who
elevated themselves from the masses by means<span class=
"note">[43]</span> of the curule magistracies. These were insolent
and purse-proud, and greedy to increase their wealth by any means
in their power. Next to these two divisions of the nobility came
those whom the patricians had been wont to despise and to relegate
to the very lowest rank under the name of <i>aerarii</i>;
merchants,<span class="note">[44]</span> manufacturers, bankers,
and farmers of the revenues. These men were powerful by reason of
their union and community of interests, and money which they
commanded. They formed a third order and even became so powerful as
to control the senate and, at times, the whole republic. In the
time of the Punic wars the senate had been obliged to let go
unpunished the crimes committed by the publican Posthumius and the
means which he had employed in order to enrich himself at the
expense of the republic, because it was imprudent to offend<span
class="note">[45]</span> the order of publicans. Thus constituted
an order or guild, they held it in their hands at will to advance
or to withhold the money for carrying on wars or sustaining the
public credit. In this way they were the masters of the state. They
also grasped the public lands, as they were able to command such
wealth that no individual could compete with them. They thus became
the only farmers of the domain lands, and they did not hesitate to
cease paying all tax on these. Who was able to demand these rents
from them? The senate? But they either composed the senate or
controlled it. The magistrates? There was no magistracy but that of
wealth. The tribunes and the people? These they had disarmed by
frequent grants of land of two to seven jugera each, and by the
establishment of numerous colonies. This was beyond doubt the real
reason for their frequent distributions. They had all been made
from land recently conquered. The ancient <i>ager</i> had not been
touched, and little by little the Licinian law had fallen into
disuetude.</p>

<p>1. Caere submitted in 353, yielding all southern Etruria to
Rome.</p>

<p>2. Volcian territory and all Latium fell to Rome at the close of
the Latin war in 339.</p>

<p>3. Capua, taken in 337.</p>

<p>4. Cales, taken in 334. In this struggle all Campania became
Roman territory.</p>

<p>5. Sabine territory submitted in 290.</p>

<p>6. Tarentum, captured in 272.</p>

<p>7. Rhegium, captured in 270.</p>

<p>8. The Galli Senones were destroyed in 283 and their whole
territory (Umbria) was confiscated.</p>

<p>9. In 293, Liguria and Transpadana Gallia were added to the
Roman confederation.</p>

<p>10. In 222, Italy was extended to its natural boundary, the
Alps, by the subjugation of the Gauls north of the Po. Of the
entire territory of Italy, 93,640 square miles, fully one-third
belonged to Rome. Thus, in the 287 years of the Republic, Roman
territory had expanded from 115, to 31,200 square<span class=
"note">[1]</span> miles.</p>

<p>At the close of the war with Hannibal, Rome further added to her
territory by the confiscation of the greater part of the Gallic
territory, Campania, Samnium, Apulia, Lucania, and Bruttii.</p>

<h4><a name="II9">SEC. 9.</a>&mdash;LATIFUNDIA.</h4>

<br />
<p>"After having pillaged the world as praetors or consuls during
time of war, the nobles again pillaged their subjects as governors
in time of peace;<span class="note">[1]</span> and upon their
return to Rome with immense riches they employed them in changing
the modest heritage of their fathers into domains vast as
provinces. In villas, which they were wont to surround with
forests, lakes and mountains ... where formerly a hundred families
lived at ease, a single one found itself restrained. In order to
increase his park, the noble bought at a small price the farm of an
old wounded soldier or peasant burdened with debt, who hastened to
squander, in the taverns of Rome, the modicum of gold which he had
received. Often he took the land without paying anything.<span
class="note">[2]</span> An ancient writer tells us of an
unfortunate involved in a law suit with a rich man because the
latter, discommoded by the bees of the poor man, his neighbor, had
destroyed them. The poor man protested that he wished to depart and
establish his swarms elsewhere, but that nowhere was he able to
find a small field where he would not again have a rich man for a
neighbor. The nabobs of the age, says Columella, had properties
which they were unable to journey round on horseback in a day, and
an inscription recently found at Viterba, shows that an aqueduct
ten miles long did not traverse the lands of any new
proprietors.... The small estate gradually disappeared from the
soil of Italy, and with it the sturdy population of laborers....
Spurius Ligustinus, a centurian, after twenty-two campaigns, at the
age of more than fifty years, did not have for himself, his wife,
and eight children more than a jugerum of land and a cabin."<span
class="note">[3]</span></p>

<p>To this masterly sketch quoted from Duruy, we can but add a few
facts. Pliny affirms that under Nero only six men possessed the
half of Africa.<span class="note">[4]</span> Seneca, who himself
possessed an immense fortune, says, concerning the rich men of his
time, that they did not content themselves with possessing the
lands that formerly had supported an entire people; they were wont
to turn the course of rivers in order to conduct them through their
possessions. They<span class="note">[5]</span> desired even to
embrace seas within their vast domains. We must here, it is true,
make some allowance for rhetoric. So, too, in the writings of
Petronius, some allowance for satire must be made, where he
represents the clerk of Trimalchio making a report of that which
has taken place in a single day upon one of the latter's farms near
Cumae. Here on the 7th of the calends<span class="note">[6]</span>
of July, were born 30 boys and 40 girls; 500,000 bushels of wheat
were harvested and 500 oxen were yoked. The clerk goes on to say
that a fire had recently broken out in the <i>Gardens of
Pompey</i>, when he is interrupted by Trimalchio asking when the
<i>Gardens of Pompey</i> had been purchased for him, and is
informed that they had been in his possession for a year.<span
class="note">[7]</span> So it appears that Trimalchio, in whom
Petronius has personified the pride, the greed, and the vices of
the rich men of his time, did not know that he was the possessor of
a magnificent domain. In another place Petronius causes Trimalchio
to say that everything which could appeal to the appetite of his
companions is raised upon one of his farms which he has not yet
visited and which is situated in the neighborhood of Terracina and
Tarentum, towns<span class="note">[8]</span> which are separated by
a distance of 300 miles. Finally, led on by his immoderate desire
to augment his riches and increase his possessions, the hero of
Petronius asks but one thing before he dies, i.e., to add
Apulia<span class="note">[9]</span> to his domains; he, however,
admits that he would not take it amiss to join Sicily to some lands
which he owned in that locality or to be able, should envy not
check him, to pass into Africa<span class="note">[10]</span>
without departing from his own possessions. All this has a basis of
fact. Trimalchio would never have been created, had not the
favorite freedmen of Nero crushed the people by their luxury,
debauches, and scandals.</p>

<p>But the condition of society pictured by Seneca and Petronius is
that of the first century of the Christian era and might not be
taken to represent the condition of affairs in the second century
B.C., had we not some data which go to prove the concentration of
property, the disparity between classes, and the depopulation of
Italy within the same century as the Gracchi. Cicero was not
considered one of the richest men in Rome, yet he possessed many
villas, and he has himself told us that one of them cost him
3,500,000 sesterces, about $147,000.<span class="note">[11]</span>
Cornelia, the mother of the Gracchi, had a country residence in the
vicinity of Micenum which cost<span class="note">[12]</span> 75,000
drachmae ($14,000); Lucullus some years afterwards bought it for
500,200 drachmae ($100,040). According to Cicero,<span class=
"note">[13]</span> Crassus had a fortune of 100,000,000 sesterces
($4,200,000). This does not astonish us when we see upon the <i>via
Appia,</i>near the ruins of the circus of Caracalla and but a short
distance from the Catacombs of St. Sebastian and the fountain of
Aegeria, the still important remains of the tomb of Caecilia
Metella, daughter of Metellus Creticus and wife of the tribune
Crassus, as the inscription testifies. It is a vast "funereal
fortress" constructed of precious marble, and which gives us the
first example of the luxury afterwards so common among the Romans.
Then, too, we remember that Crassus was wont to say that no one was
rich who was not able to support an army with his revenues, to
raise six legions and a great number of auxiliaries, both infantry
and cavalry.<span class="note">[14]</span></p>

<p>Pliny confirms this statement concerning Crassus, but adds that
Sulla was even richer.<span class="note">[15]</span> Plutarch gives
us fuller details and also explains the origin of the colossal
fortune of Crassus. According to him Crassus had 300 talents
($345,000), with which to commence. Upon his departure for the
Parthian war in which he lost his life, he made an inventory of his
property and found that he was possessed of 7,100 talents,
$8,165,000, double what Cicero attributes to him. How did Crassus
increase his fortune so enormously? Plutarch says that he bought
the property confiscated by Sulla at a very low figure. Then, he
had a great number of slaves distinguished for their talents;
lecturers, writers, bankers, business men, physicians, and
hotel-keepers, who turned over to him the benefits which they
realized in their diverse industries. Moreover, he had among his
slaves 500 masons and architects. Rome was built almost entirely of
wood and the houses were very high, consequently fires were
frequent and destructive. As soon as a fire broke out, Crassus
hastened to the place with his throng of slaves, bought the now
burning buildings&mdash;as well as those threatened&mdash;at a
song, and then set his slaves to work extinguishing the fires. By
this means he had become possessed of a large<span class=
"note">[16]</span> part of Rome.</p>

<p>Some other facts confirm that which Plutarch tells us of
Crassus. Athenaeus<span class="note">[17]</span> says that it was
not rare to find Roman citizens possessed of 20,000 slaves. At the
commencement of the civil war between C&aelig;sar and Pompey, the
future dictator found opposed to him, in Picenum, Domitius<span
class="note">[18]</span> Ahenobarbus at the head of thirty cohorts.
Domitius seeing his troops wavering, promised to each of them four
jugera out of his own possessions, and a proportionate part to the
centurians and veterans. What must have been the fortune of a man
who was able to distribute out of his own lands, and surely without
bankrupting himself, about 100,000 jugera?</p>

<h4><a name="II10">SEC. 10.</a>&mdash;THE INFLUENCE OF
SLAVERY.</h4>

<br />
<p>The last of the evils which we wish to mention as bringing about
the deplorable condition of the plebeians at the time of the
Gracchi, and which brought more degradation and ruin in its train
than all the others, is slavery. Licinius Stolo had attempted in
vain to combat it. Twenty-four centuries of fruitless legislation
since his death has scarcely yet taught the most enlightened
nations that it is a waste of energy to regulate by law the
greatest crime against humanity, so long as the conditions which
produced it remain the same. The Roman legions, sturdy plebeians,
marched on to the conquest of the world. For what? To bring home
vast throngs of captives who were destined, as slaves, to eat the
bread, to sap the life blood, of their conquerors. The substitution
of slaves for freemen in the labors of the city and country, in the
manual arts and industries, grew in proportion to the number of
captives sold in the markets of Rome. All the rich men followed
more or less the example of Crassus; they had among their slaves,
weavers, carvers, embroiderers, painters, architects, physicians,
and teachers. Suetonius tells us that Augustus wore no clothing
save that manufactured by slaves in his own house. Atticus hired
his slaves to the public in the capacity of copyists. Cicero used
slaves as amanuenses. The government employed slaves in the
subordinate posts in administration; the police, the guard of
monuments and arsenals, the manufacture of arms and munitions of
war, the building of navies, etc. The priests of the temples and
the colleges of pontiffs had their familiae of slaves.</p>

<p>Thus in the city, plebeians found no employment. Competition was
impossible between fathers of families and slaves who labored <i>en
masse</i> in the vast work-shops of their masters, with no return
save the scantiest subsistence, no families, no cares, and most of
all no army service. In the country it was still worse. It would
appear that none but slaves were employed in the cultivation of the
land. Doubtless the number of slaves in Italy has been greatly
exaggerated, but it is certain that the substitution of slave labor
for free, was an old fact when Licinius<span class=
"note">[1]</span> attempted by the formal disposition of his law to
check the evil. In the first centuries of Rome, slaves must have
been scarce. They were still dear in the time of Cato, and even
Plutarch mentions as a proof of the avarice of the illustrious<span
class="note">[2]</span> censor, that he never paid more than 15,000
drachmae for a slave. After the great conquests of the Romans, in
Corsica, Sardinia, Spain, Greece, and the Orient, the market went
down by reason of the multitude of human beings thrown upon it. An
able-bodied, unlettered man could be bought for the price of an ox.
Such were the men of Spain, Thrace, and Sardinia. Educated slaves
from Greece and the East brought a higher price. We learn from
Horace, that his slave Davus whom he has rendered so celebrated,
cost him 500 drachmae.<span class="note">[3]</span> Diodorus of
Siculus says that the rich caused their slaves to live by their own
exertions. According to him the knights employed great bands of
slaves in Sicily, both for agricultural purposes and for herding
stock, but they furnished them with so little food that they must
either starve or live by brigandage. The governors of the island
did not dare to punish these slaves for fear of the powerful order
which owned them.<span class="note">[4]</span> Slave labor was thus
adopted for economic reasons, and, for the same reasons,
agriculture in Italy was abandoned for stock raising.</p>

<p>Says Varro:<span class="note">[5]</span> "Fathers of families
rather delight in circuses and theatres than in farming and grape
culture. Therefore, we pay that wheat necessary for our subsistence
be imported from Africa and Sardinia; we pick our grapes in the
isles of Cos and Chios. In this land where our fathers who founded
Rome instructed their children in agriculture, we see the
descendants of those skillful cultivators, by reason of avarice and
in contempt of laws, transferring arable lands into pasture fields,
perhaps ignorant of the fact that agriculture and fatherland were
one."</p>

<p>Fewer men were needed for the care of these pasture lands; but
the evil did not stop here. Little by little these pasture lands
were transformed into mere pleasure grounds attached to villas.
This had already begun to take place as early as the second Punic
war, when the plains of Sinuessa<span class="note">[6]</span> and
Falernia were cultivated rather for pleasure than the necessaries
of life; so that the army of Fabius could find nothing upon which
to sustain itself. Under these influences the plebeians, in 133,
had become merely a turbulent, restless mass, but full of the
activity and the energy which had characterized them in the early
centuries of the republic. They were composed chiefly of the
descendants of the ancient plebeian families, decimated by wars and
by misery. They were the heirs of those for whom Spurius Cassius,
Terentillius Arsa, Virginius, Licinius Stolo, Publilius Philo, and
Hortensius had endured so many conflicts and even shed their blood;
but they had become brutalized by poverty, debauchery, and crime.
No longer able to support themselves by labor, they had become
beggars and vagabonds.</p>

<br />
<h4><a name="II11">SEC. 11.</a>&mdash;LEX SEMPRONIA TIBERIANA.</h4>

<br />
<p>In 133, more than two centuries after the enactment of the law
of Licinius Stolo, Tiberius Gracchus, tribune of the people for
that year, brought forward a bill which was in fact little less
than a renewal of the old law. It provided that no one should
occupy more than five hundred jugera of the <i>ager publicus,</i>
with the proviso that any father could reserve<span class=
"note">[1]</span> 250 jugera for each son.<span class=
"note">[2]</span> This law differed from that of Licinius in that
it guaranteed permanent possession of this amount to the occupier
and his heirs forever.<span class="note">[3]</span> Other clauses
were subjoined providing for the payment<span class=
"note">[4]</span> of some equivalent to the rich for the
improvements and the buildings upon the surrendered estates, and
ordering the division of the domain thus surrendered among the
poorer citizens in lots of 30 jugera each, on the condition that
their portions should be inalienable.<span class=
"note">[5]</span>They bound themselves to use the land for
agricultural purposes and to pay a moderate rent to the state. It
appears that the Italians were not excluded from the benefit of
this law.<span class="note">[6]</span></p>

<p>The design of this bill was to recruit the ranks of the Romans
by drafts of freeholders from among the Latins. Such as had been
reduced to poverty were to be restored to independence. Such as had
been sunk beneath oppression were to be lifted up to liberty.<span
class="note">[7]</span> No more generous scheme had ever been
brought before the Romans. None ever met with more determined
opposition, and for this there was much reason. There might have
been some like the tribune's friends ready to part with the lands
bequeathed to them by their fathers; but where one was willing to
confess, a hundred stood ready to deny the claim upon them. Nor had
they any such demands to meet as those of the olden times. Then the
plebeians were a firm and compact body which demanded a share of
recent conquests that their own blood and courage had gained. Now
it was a loose and feeble body of various members waiting for a
share in land long since conquered, while their patron rather than
their leader exerted himself for them.</p>

<p>Tiberius, like Licinius, met with violent opposition, but he had
not like him the patience and the fortitude to wait the slower but
safer process of legitimate agitation. He adopted a course<span
class="note">[8]</span> which is always dangerous and especially so
in great political movements. Satisfied with the justice of his
bill and stung by taunts and incensed by opposition, he resolved to
carry it by open violation of law. He caused his colleague,
Octavius, who had interposed his veto, to be removed from office by
a vote of the citizens&mdash;a thing unheard of and, according to
the Roman constitution, impossible&mdash;and in this way his bill
for the division of the public land was carried and became a law.
It required the appointing of three commissioners to receive and
apportion the public domain.<span class="note">[9]</span> This
collegium of three persons,<span class="note">[10]</span> who were
regarded as ordinary and standing magistrates of the state, and
were annually elected by the assembly of the people, was entrusted
with the work of resumption and distribution. The important and
difficult task of legally settling what was domain land and what
was private property was afterward added to these functions.
Tiberius himself, his brother Caius, then at Numantia, and his
father-in-law, Claudius, were nominated, according to the usual
custom of intrusting the execution of a law to its author and his
chosen adherents.<span class="note">[11]</span> The distribution
was designed to go on continually and to embrace the whole class
that should be in need of aid. The new features of this agraria lex
of Sempronius, as compared with the Licinio-Sextian, were, first,
the clause in favor of the hereditary possessors; secondly, the
payment of quit-rent, and inalienable tenure proposed for the new
allotments; thirdly, and especially, the permanent executive, the
want of which, under the older law, had been the chief reason why
it had remained without lasting practical application.<span class=
"note">[12]</span></p>

<p>The dissatisfaction of the supporters of the law concurred with
the resistance of its opponents in preventing its execution or at
least greatly embarrassing the collegium. The senate refused to
grant the customary outfit to which the commissioners<span class=
"note">[13]</span> were entitled. They proceeded without it. Then
the landowners denied that they occupied any of the public land, or
else asked such enormous indemnities as to render the recovery
impossible without violence. This roused opposition. The <i>ager
publicus</i> had never been surveyed, private boundaries had in
many cases been obliterated, and, except where natural boundaries
marked the limit of the domain land, it was impossible to ascertain
what was <i>ager publicus</i> and what <i>ager privatus</i>. To
avoid this difficulty the commission adopted the just but hazardous
expediency of throwing the burden of proof upon the occupier. He
was summoned before their tribunal and, unless he could establish
his boundaries or prove that the land in question had never been a
part of the domain land, it was declared <i>ager publicus</i> and
confiscated.<span class="note">[14]</span></p>

<p>On the other hand the newly made proprietors were contending
with one another, if not with the commissioners. The Italians were,
in some cases, despoiled instead of relieved by the law. The
complaints of those turned out of their estates to make room for
the clamorous swarms from the city, drowned the thanks of such as
obtained a portion of the lands. Not even with the wealth of
Attalus had Tiberius bought friends enough to aid him at this
time.<span class="note">[15]</span> The same spirit of lawlessness
which he himself had invoked in the passing of his law, was in turn
made use of by his enemies to crush him. Having been absent from
Rome while performing his duties as commissioner, he now returned
as a candidate for re-election to the tribunate, a thing in itself
contrary to law, and in the struggle which arose over his
re-election, was slain a little more than six months after his
appointment<span class="note">[16]</span> to membership in the
collegium.</p>

<p><i>Uncertainty as to the Details of the Lex Sempronia.</i> We
are very imperfectly informed upon many points in Tiberius'
agrarian law. In the first place, the question arises, were those
persons holding less than 500 jugera at the time of its enactment
given their lands as <i>bona fide</i> private property with the
privilege of making up the deficiency? If not, then the law,
instead of punishing, would seem to reward violation of its tenets,
and he who had with boldness appropriated the greatest quantity of
domain land would now be an object of envy to his more honest but
less fortunate neighbors.</p>

<p>Secondly, what arrangement was made as to the buildings and
improvements already upon the land? Were these handed over to the
new owners without any payment on their part? This would work great
inequality in the value of allotments made, and yet we cannot see
where the poor man was to obtain the money to pay for these. Then
again, what was to become of the numerous slaves which had hitherto
carried on the agriculture now destined to be performed by small
holders? Their masters would have no further use for them and would
consequently swell the lists of freedmen in order to avoid the
expense of feeding them. This law was passed in the midst of the
Sicilian slave war and Tiberius Gracchus would surely not have
neglected to make some provision to meet this exigency. The law as
it stands in its imperfect condition seems to be the work of an
ignorant, unprincipled political charlatan, but we are convinced
Tiberius was not that. Moreover, we know that he had the help of
one of Rome's most able lawyers, Publius Mucius Scaevola, and the
advice of his father-in-law, Appius Claudius, who was something of
a statesman. We are therefore convinced that some conditions which
were to meet these obstacles were enacted. We must admit, however,
that it is a little surprising that no fragment of such conditions
has ever reached us in the literature of Rome.</p>

<p><i>Results of this Law.</i> Although Tiberius was dead, yet his
law still lived, and, indeed, received added force from the death
of its author. The senate killed Gracchus but could not annul his
law. The party which was favorable to the distribution of the
domain land gained control of affairs. Gaius Gracchus, Marcus
Fulvius Flaccus, and Gaius Papirius Carbo, were the chief persons
in carrying the law into effect. Mommsen (vol. III, p. 128) says:
"The work of resuming and distributing the occupied domain land was
prosecuted with zeal and energy; and, in fact, proofs to that
effect are not wanting. As early as 622(i.e. from the Foundation of
Rome, =132 B.C.) the consul of that year, Publius Popillius, the
same who presided over the prosecution of the adherents of Tiberius
Gracchus, recorded on a public monument that he was 'the first who
had turned the shepherd out of the domains and installed farmers in
their stead;' and tradition otherwise affirms that the distribution
extended over all Italy, and that in the formerly existing
communities the number of farmers was everywhere
augmented&mdash;for it was the design of the Sempronian agrarian
law to elevate the former class, not by the founding of new
communities, but by the strengthening of those already in
existence.</p>

<p>"The extent and the comprehensive effect of these distributions
are attested by the numerous arrangements in the Roman art of
land-measuring referable to the Gracchan assignations of land; for
instance, the due placing of boundary stones, so as to obviate
future mistakes, appears to have been first suggested by the
Gracchan courts for defining boundaries and by the distribution of
land.</p>

<p>"But the number on the burgess-rolls gives the clearest
evidence. The census, which was published in 623, and actually took
place probably in the beginning of 622, yielded not more than
319,000 burgesses capable of bearing arms, whereas six years
afterwards (629), in place of the previous falling off (p. 108),
the number rises to 395,000, that is 76,000 of an increase beyond
all doubt solely in consequence of what the allotment commission
did for Roman burgesses."</p>

<p>Ihne says, concerning this same commission (vol. IV, p. 409):
"The triumvirs entered upon their duties under the most unfavorable
circumstances.... We may entertain serious doubts whether they or
their immediate successors ever got beyond this first stage of
their labors, and whether they really accomplished the task of
setting up any considerable number of independent freeholders."
Ihne further says (vol. IV, p. 408, n. 1), in answer to the
statements made by Mommsen, which we have quoted above: "There is
an obvious fallacy in this argument, for how could the assignment
of allotments to poor citizens increase the number of citizens?
There is nothing to justify the assumption that non-citizens were
to share in the benefit of the land-law, and that by receiving
allotments they were to be advanced to the rank of citizens. If the
statements respecting the census of 131 B.C. and 125 B.C. are to be
trusted, the great increase in the number of citizens must be
explained in another way. It is possible ... that after the revolt
of Fregellae (125 B.C.) a portion of the allies were admitted to
the Roman franchise by several plebiscites. We know nothing of such
plebiscites; but it is not unlikely that the Roman senate in 125
B.C. acted on the principle of making timely concessions to a
portion of the rebels, and thus preventing unanimous action among
them. This is what was done in 90 B.C. during the great Social War.
By such an admission of allies, the increase of citizens between
131 and 125 might possibly be explained."</p>

<p>If we examine the objections which Ihne raises we shall not find
them so formidable as first appears. Mommsen does not say that the
number of citizens was increased. What he does say is that the
number of burgesses capable of bearing arms was increased (vol.
III, p. 128). In 570-184, the Servian Military Constitution was so
modified as to admit to service in the burgess army, persons
possessed of but 4,000 asses ($85). In case of need all those who
were bound to serve in the fleet, <i>i.e.</i> those rated between
4,000 and 1,500 asses and all freedmen, together with the free-born
rated between 1,500 asses ($30) and 375 asses ($7.50), were
enrolled in the burgess infantry.<span class="note">[17]</span> It
is easy enough to see that the gift on the part of the government
of 30 jugera (24 acres) of land to each poor citizen, would raise
him from the ranks of the proletariate and make him liable to
military service.</p>

<p>This is sufficient to establish Mommsen's thesis;<span class=
"note">[18]</span> and it is not necessary to consider the second
point, viz., that non-citizens were not to share in the benefit of
the land law nor thereby to be raised to the rank of citizens,
although to us it would be no more difficult to believe this than
that 76,000 allies had been admitted to the Roman franchise "by
several plebiscites" no trace or rumor of which had been
preserved.</p>

<p>It can hardly be supposed that the Italian farmers were
multiplied at the same ratio as were the Romans; but the result
must have been most beneficial even to them.</p>

<p>In the accomplishing of this result, respectable interests and
existing rights were no doubt violated. The commission itself was
composed of violent partisans who, being judges unto themselves,
did not scruple to carry out their plans even at the cost of
recklessness and tumult. Loud complaints were made, but usually to
no avail. If the domain question was to be settled at all, the
matter could not be carried through without some such rigor of
action. Intelligent Romans wished to see the plan thoroughly
tested. But this acquiescence had a limit. The Italian domain was
not all in the hands of Roman citizens. Allied communities held the
usufruct of large tracts of it by means of decrees of the people or
the senate, and other portions had been taken possession of by
Latin burgesses. These in turn were attacked by the commissioners;
but to give fresh offense to these Latini, who were already
overburdened with military service, without share in the spoils,
was a matter of doubtful policy.</p>

<p>The Latini appealed to Scipio in person, and by his influence a
bill was passed by the people which withdrew from the commission
its jurisdiction and remitted to the consuls the decision as to
what were private and what domain lands. This was a mild way of
killing the law, and resulted in that. It had, however, in great
measure, fulfilled its object and left little territory in the
hands of the Roman state.</p>

<h4><a name="II12">SEC. 12.</a>&mdash;LEX SEMPRONIA GAIANA.</h4>

<br />
<p>Gaius Gracchus really enacted no new agrarian law but merely
re-established the power of the commission which had been appointed
by his brother ten years before; which power they had lost by the
law of Scipio.<span class="note">[1]</span> Gaius' law was enacted
merely to preserve the principle, and the distribution of land, if
resumed at all, was on a very limited scale. This is made known
from the fact that the burgess-roll showed precisely the same
number capable of bearing arms in 124 and 114. As has already been
stated, the domain land had been exhausted by the commission before
losing its power, and, therefore, Gaius had none to
distribute.<span class="note">[2]</span> The land held by the
Latini could only be taken into consideration with the difficult
question of the Roman franchise. But when Gaius proposed the
establishment of colonies in Italy, at Tarentum and Capua, whose
territories had been hitherto reserved as a source of revenue to
the treasury,<span class="note">[3]</span> he went a step beyond
his brother and made this also liable to be parcelled out; not,
however, according to the method of Tiberius, who did not
contemplate the establishment of new communities, but according to
the colonial system. There can be little doubt that Gaius designed
to aid in permanently establishing<span class="note">[4]</span> the
revolution by means of these new colonies in the most fertile part
of all Italy. His overthrow and death put a stop to the
establishment of the contemplated colonies and left this territory
still tributary to the treasury.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <a name="III">III.</a></h3>

<h4>SEC. <a name="III13">13.</a>&mdash;LEX THORIA.<span class=
"note">[1]</span></h4>

<br />
<p>According to Appian, during the years which followed the death
of Gaius Gracchus up to the tribunate of Saturninus, that is to
say, between the years 120 and 100, three agrarian laws were
proposed and adopted.</p>

<p>1. A law "That the holders of the land which was the matter in
dispute might legally sell<span class="note">[2]</span> it."
Appian, who is the only authority for this period, does not give
the date of the law nor the name of the tribune who proposed it,
but Ihne<span class="note">[3]</span> makes the date 118, and
Mommsen assigns the law to Marcus<span class="note">[4]</span>
Drusus. This law was a repeal of all the restrictions which the
Gracchi had placed upon assignments of public land. The object of
this clause was to secure the success of their great reforms, and
to establish a number of small proprietors who would cultivate
their little farms, and breed citizens and soldiers. But forced
cultivation is impossible, and sumptuary laws have never yet
succeeded in increasing<span class="note">[5]</span> population.
Again it is inconsistent to give land to a man and deprive him of
the power of sale, for this is an essential part of that domain
which we call property in land. If a man wishes to sell, he will
always have sufficient reasons for so doing, and a rich man can
afford to pay<span class="note">[6]</span> the highest price,
freedom of exchange thus bringing ultimate good to both parties. It
is easy to comprehend the consequences of this law. It was the
commencement of a reaction entirely aristocratic in its
nature.<span class="note">[7]</span> It was skillfully conducted
with the ordinary spirit of the Roman senate, the ruses, mental
reservations, and dissimulations under guise of public interest.
The aristocracy presented to the plebeian farmers, established by
the lex Sempronia, a means of promptly and easily satisfying their
passions. They had never earned their little farms, nor did they
appreciate the independence of the tiller of the soil. Unaccustomed
to farm labor,<span class="note">[8]</span> and the plodding
unexciting life of the Roman <i>agricola</i>, they made haste to
abandon a toilsome husbandry, the results of which seemed to them
slow and uncertain, and with the pieces of silver which they
received as the price of their lands, returned to Rome to swell the
idle and vicious throng<span class="note">[9]</span> which enjoyed
the sweet privilege of an existence sustained without labor.</p>

<p>Thus the nobles re-entered promptly and cheaply into the
possession of the lands of which Tiberius had but a short time
before deprived them, and, by means of a little sacrifice,
substantially and legally converted their possessions into real
property, while the plebeians whom Tiberius had wished to elevate
by means of forcing<span class="note">[10]</span> upon them the
necessity of labor, fell back into their accustomed poverty and
brutality. But the object for which the nobles were striving was
not yet completely gained. The present victory was theirs; they now
strove to guarantee the future, and so render impossible dangers
similar to those already passed through.</p>

<p>2. A second law was thus enacted: "Spurius Borius, a tribune,
proposed a law to this effect; that there should be no more
distribution of the public land, but it should be left to the
possessors who should pay certain charges (<i>vectigalia</i>) for
it to the state <a href="#13">(&delta;&eta;&mu;&omega;)</a>(daemo)
and that the money arising from these payments should be
distributed."<span class="note">[11]</span></p>

<p>It is easy to comprehend the effect of a law so conceived. On
the one hand it guaranteed to the possessors full property in the
public lands which they held. From this point of view it was
aristocratic. But on the other hand it aimed to unite the interests
of the common people with those of the aristocracy, by placing a
tax of one tenth of the produce upon the holders of these
lands,<span class="note">[12]</span> thus re&euml;stablishing the
law which had been annulled by Drusus. This took the place of
distributions of land, which had now been made impossible<span
class="note">[13]</span> in Italy. In reality this law was
disastrous to the plebeians as it established a tax<span class=
"note">[14]</span> for their benefit, a <i>congiarium</i>, and
placed a premium upon laziness.</p>

<p>The narration of Appian presents some grave difficulties. In all
the manuscripts of Appian the name of the tribune proposing the
second law is Spurius Borius.<span class="note">[15]</span> Cicero
mentions a tribune by the name of Spurius<span class=
"note">[16]</span> Thorius and Schweigh&auml;user in his edition of
Appian has changed 'Borius' to 'Thorius.' But this does not lessen
the difficulty, as the law which Cicero attributes to Thorius is
entirely different from the second law of Appian which, according
to him was introduced by Spurius Borius. Cicero says that Spurius
Thorius "freed the public lands from the vectigal."<span class=
"note">[17]</span> Appian says that Spurius Borius guaranteed the
<i>possessions</i> in the public lands, levying a tax on them for
the benefit of the people. It is a sheer waste of time to attempt
to harmonize these two statements.<span class="note">[18]</span>
Granting that Spurius Borius and Spurius Thorius are one and the
same person, the statements still remain diametrically opposed
according to a simple and commonly accepted translation of Cicero's
words: "Sp. Thorius satis valuit in populari genere dicendi, is qui
agrum publicum vitiosa et inutile lege vectigali levavit." Mommsen
makes Cicero agree with Appian by changing "vectigali" into the
instrument, and rendering<span class="note">[l9]</span> "relieved
the public land from a vicious and useless law by imposing a
vectigal." No other writer agrees with Mommsen in making such a
translation.</p>

<p>3. The third law is mentioned by Appian alone who says: "Now
when the law of Gracchus had once been evaded by these tricks, an
excellent law and most useful to the state if it could have been
executed, another tribune not long after
(&omicron;&upsilon;&pi;&omicron;&lambda;&upsilon;
&upsilon;&sigma;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;nu;) (oupolu husteron)
abolished even the vectigalia."<span class="note">[20]</span> This
is evidently the same law which Cicero mentions as that of Spurius
Thorius and as he also mentions him in another place (<i>De
Or</i>., II, 70, 284), we may possibly accept him as the
author.</p>

<p>There are still extant some fragments of a bronze tablet which
contains upon its smooth surface the Lex Repetundarum and has cut
upon its rough<span class="note">[21]</span> back an agrarian law.
These fragments were discovered in the 16th century among the
collections in the Museum of Cardinal<span class="note">[22]</span>
Bembo at Padua. Sigonius attempted the reconstruction of this law
and after him Haubold and Klentze, but Rudorff has completed the
reconstruction as far as possible and made the law the subject of
an interesting essay.<span class="note">[23]</span> Mommsen has a
commentary in the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum<span class=
"note">[24]</span> upon this law. From all these sources the date
of this law has been established almost beyond doubt as 111.
Sigonius assigned it to Spurius Thorius, and, as the name is
immaterial and<span class="note">[25]</span> his arguments moreover
for this title are not easily set aside, we can do no better than
adopt it.</p>

<h4><i>Argument of the Lex Thoria.</i><span class=
"note">[26]</span></h4>

<p>The law evidently consists of three parts, although the rubricae
are absent.</p>

<p>I. De agro publico p. R. in Italia (1-43).</p>

<p>II. De agro publico p. R. in Africa (44&mdash;95).</p>

<p>III. De agro publico p. R. qui Corinthorum fuit (96-105).</p>

<h4>I. On the Ager Publicus in Italy.</h4>

<p>This part may be divided roughly into three sections: (1) Lines
1-24, defining <i>ager privatus</i>; (2) 24-32, defining <i>ager
publicus</i>; (3) 33-43, on disputed cases.</p>

<p>It thus embraces the first forty-three lines of the law, and is
concerned with the public land of Italy, from the Rubicon
southwards. It commences by referring to the condition of this land
in the year 133, when Tiberius Gracchus was tribune. The law does
not affect to touch any thing which had been enacted concerning
this land prior to 133. It either confirms or alters what had been
done in 133, and since that time. All the public land which was
exempted from the operation of the Sempronian laws, <i>i.e.</i>,
<i>Ager Campanus</i> and <i>Ager Stellatis</i>, was also excluded
from the operation of the <i>lex Thoria</i>.</p>

<p>(1) The first ten lines of the law relate to that part of the
ager publicus which was occupied before the time of the Gracchi, if
the amount of such land did not exceed the maximum fixed by the
Sempronian laws;</p>

<p>(2) Also, to the assignments made by lot (<i>sortito</i>) to
Roman citizens by the commissioners since the enactment of the
Sempronian laws, if such assignments were not made out of land
which had been guaranteed to the old possessors;</p>

<p>(3) Also, to all lands taken from an old possessor, but on his
complaint restored to him by the commissioners;</p>

<p>(4) Also, to all houses and lands, in Rome or in other parts of
Italy, which the commissioners had granted without lot, so as such
grants did not interfere with the guaranteed title of older
possessors;</p>

<p>(5) Also, to all the public land which Gaius Sempronius, or the
commissioners, in carrying out his law, had used in the
establishment of colonies or given to settlers, whether Roman
citizens, Latini, or Italian Socii, or which they had caused to be
entered on the "<i>formae</i>" or "<i>tabulae</i>."</p>

<p>All the lands comprised in the above are declared in lines seven
and eight to be private property, in these words: "Ager locus omnis
quei supra scriptus est, extra eum agrum locum, quei ager locus ex
lege plebeivescito, quod C. Sempronius Ti. f. tr. pl. rogavit,
exsceptum cavitumve est nei divideretur ... privatus esto."</p>

<p>Lines 8-10 declare that the censors shall, from time to time,
enter this land upon their books like any other private property;
and it is further declared that nothing shall be said or done in
the senate to disturb the peaceful enjoyment of this land by those
persons possessing it.</p>

<p>Of lines 11-13 (ch. II) nothing definite can be said, because of
the few words which have been preserved.<span class=
"note">[27]</span> Rudorff explains them as referring to land
granted to <i>viasii vicani</i> (dwellers in villages along the
roads), by the Sempronian commissioners; such lands to remain in
their possession, but to be theoretically <i>ager publicus.</i></p>

<p>Lines 13-14 refer to lands occupied since 133 <i>agri colendi
causa</i>. They allow to every Roman citizen the privilege of
occupying, for the purpose of cultivation, thirty jugera of public
land; they further declare that he who shall possess or have not
more than thirty jugera of such land, shall possess and have it as
private property,<span class="note">[28]</span> with the provision
that land so occupied shall be no part of the public land excepted
from appropriation, and further, that such occupation shall not
interfere with the guaranteed lands of a previous possessor.</p>

<p>Lines 14-15 relate to holders of pasture land (<i>ager
compascuus</i>). This <i>ager compascuus</i> was land which had
been left undivided, and had not become the private property of any
individual, but was the common property of the owners of the
adjacent lands. These persons had the right to pasture stock upon
this land by paying pasture dues (<i>scriptura</i> or
<i>vectigal</i>) to the state. The <i>Thoria lex</i> freed these
lands from the <i>vectigal</i> or <i>scriptura</i>, and granted
free pasturage to each man for ten head of large
beasts&mdash;cattle, asses, and horses&mdash;and fifty head of
smaller animals&mdash;sheep, goats, and swine. This common pasture
must be carefully distinguished from the communal property which
was granted to the settlers in a Colonia and called "<i>compascua
publica</i>" with the additional title<span class=
"note">[29]</span> of the colony, as "<i>Julienses</i>."</p>

<p>These rights of common resemble, in some respects, the English
common of pasture as described by Bracton.<span class=
"note">[30]</span> By English customary law, every freeholder
holding land within a manor, had the right of common of pasturage
on the lord's wastes as an incident to his land.</p>

<p>Lines 15-16. The possession of land, granted by the
commissioners in a colony since 133, to be confirmed before the
Ides of March next.</p>

<p>Lines 16-17. The same rule applied to lands granted otherwise by
the same commissioners.</p>

<p>Line 18. Such occupants if forcibly ejected to be restored.</p>

<p>Lines 19-20. Land assigned by the Sempronian commission, in
compensation for land in a colony which had been made public, to
become private.</p>

<p>Lines 23-24. Confirmation of the title or restitution of such
land to be made before the Ides of March next.</p>

<p>Lines 24-25. Land besides this which remains public is not to be
occupied, but to be left free to the public for grazing. A fine for
occupation is imposed. The law allowed all persons to feed their
beasts great and small on this public pasture, up to the number
mentioned in lines 14-15 as the limit to be pastured on the <i>ager
campascuus</i>, free of all tax. This, according to Rudorff, was
done for the benefit of the small holders. Those who sent more than
this number of animals to the public pastures must pay a
<i>scriptura</i>, for each head.</p>

<p>Line 26. While the cattle or sheep were driven along the
'<i>calles</i>,' or beast-tracks, and along the public roads to the
pasture grounds, no charge was made for what they consumed along
the road.</p>

<p>Line 27. Land given in compensation out of public land, to be
<i>privatus utei quoi optuma lege</i>.</p>

<p>Line 27. Land taken in this way from private ownership to be
<i>publicus</i>, as in 133.</p>

<p>Lines 27-28. Land given in compensation for <i>ager patritus</i>
to be itself <i>patritus</i>.</p>

<p>Line 28. Public roads to remain as before.</p>

<p>Line 29. Whatever Latins and <i>peregrini</i> might do in 112,
and whatever is not forbidden citizens to do by this law, they may
do henceforward.</p>

<p>Lines 29-30. Trial of a Latin to be the same as for a Roman
citizen.</p>

<p>Lines 31-32. Territory (1) of borough towns or colonies (2), in
trientabulis, to be, as before, public.</p>

<p>Lines 33-34. Cases of dispute about land made private between
133 and 111, or by this law, to be judged by the consul or praetor
before next Ides of March.</p>

<p>Lines 35-36. Cases of dispute after this date to be tried by
consuls, praetors, or censors.</p>

<p>Lines 36-39. Judgment on money owing to publicani to be given by
consuls, proconsuls, praetors or propraetors.</p>

<p>Line 40. No one to be prejudiced by refusing to swear to laws
contrary to this law.</p>

<p>Lines 41-42. No one to be prejudiced by refusing to obey laws
contrary to this law.</p>

<p>Lines 43-44. On the colony of Sipontum (?).</p>

<p>Thus we see that the <i>lex Thoria</i> had two main objects in
view: (1) The guaranteeing to possessors full property in the land
which they occupied. (2) The freeing from <i>vectigal</i> or
<i>scriptura</i> the property of every one.</p>

<p>In this way was the reaction of the aristocracy completed. It
left nothing of the Sempronian law. Appian<span class=
"note">[31]</span> has fully comprehended all this, and, in his
enumeration of the three laws, connection between which he
indicates, we see clearly the entire revolutionary system,
conducted, we must admit, with a rare address and a perfidy which
rendered the effect certain. The aristocracy did not rest. As soon
as they had gained the people by their new bait of money and food,
soothed them by their apparent generosity, and familiarized them
with the idea that the <i>possessions</i> of the nobles were not
only legally acquired but inviolable, then they raised the mask,
and by a bold step swept away the <i>vectigal</i>,<span class=
"note">[32]</span> thus leaving their property free. The enactment
of this law virtually closed the long struggle between patrician
and plebeian over the public lands of Rome, and left them as full
property in the hands of the rich nobility. The results could
hardly have been otherwise. Sumptuary laws, false economic
principles, had closed all channels<span class="note">[33]</span>
of trade and manufacture to the nobility, while conquest had filled
their hands with gold and placed at their disposal vast
numbers<span class="note">[34]</span> of slaves. There was but one
channel open for the investment of this gold,&mdash;the
agrarian.<span class="note">[35]</span> Farming and cattle-raising
were the only occupations in which slaves could be used with
advantage and so, as a natural result of Roman economics, the
plebeian, with little or no money and subject to the military call,
was compelled to enter into a one-sided contest with capital and
slave labor. So long as these conditions existed so long would all
the laws of the world fail to save him from abject poverty and its
attendant evils.</p>

<h4><a name="III14">SEC. 14.</a>&mdash;AGRARIAN MOVEMENTS BETWEEN
111 AND 86.</h4>

<br />
<p>In the year following the enactment of the <i>lex Thoria</i>,
or, by some other authorities, in 105, an agrarian law was proposed
by a tribune named Marcus Philippus. Cicero is the only writer who
mentions it, and he has given us no information concerning its
tendency and dispositions. We only know from him that it was
rejected.<span class="note">[1]</span> Probably the whole thing was
merely a political ruse in order to gain an election or to be
handsomely bought off by the nobility. It, however, presents one
point of interest to us. The introduction of the bill was preceded
by a speech, in which the tribune, in justifying his undertaking,
affirmed that there were not two thousand citizens who had wealth.
Cicero has made no attempt to refute this, and must, therefore,
have judged it true. It reveals the fact that Rome was in a
deplorable condition.</p>

<p>In chronological order the first agrarian law after the vain
attempt of Philippus was that of Lucius Appuleius Saturninus. In
the year 100, he brought forward a bill for the distribution of
land in Africa<span class="note">[2]</span> to the soldiers of
Marius. Each soldier was to receive one hundred jugera of land. No
distinction was to be made between Roman and Latin. This bill
received the sanction of the assembly and became a law, but force
was the chief instrumentality in bringing this about. This law, so
far as can be ascertained, was never enforced, so that when the
same man, three years later, brought forward another agrarian bill,
he took the precaution to add a clause binding every senator, under
heavy penalty, to confirm the law by the most solemn oath.<span
class="note">[3]</span> The first law was enacted in order to
provide the soldiers of Marius with suitable farms when they
returned from the campaign in Numidia. The author doubtless acted
with the aid and hearty co&ouml;peration of Marius. When Saturninus
brought forward his second bill, Marius<span class=
"note">[4]</span> had returned from the north as the hero of Aquae
Sextiae and was present to help. The nobility as one man opposed
the scheme; the town-people were the clients of the rich. If
Marius<span class="note">[5]</span> and Saturninus were to succeed,
it must be by the aid of the country burgess and the soldier. With
the legions that fought at Vercellae drawn up in the town, amid
riot and bloodshed, the assembly passed the bill. The senate,
together with Marius himself, for a time demurred from taking the
oath. Finally,<span class="note">[6]</span> at the instigation of
"the man from the ranks," who had come to the conclusion that it
was best to subscribe, all save one, Metellus, took the oath. The
law enacted that assignments of land in the country of the Gauls,
in Sicily, Achaia, and Macedonia, should be made; that colonies
should be established, and that Marius should be the head of the
commission entrusted with the establishment of all these
settlements.<span class="note">[7]</span> These colonies were to
consist of Roman citizens; and, in order that Latini,<span class=
"note">[8]</span> their companions in arms, might participate in
the grants, Marius was invested with power to bestow the franchise
upon a certain number of these. But no one of these colonies was
ever founded. The only colony of the year 100 was Eporedia<span
class="note">[9]</span> (Ivrea), in the northwestern Alps, and it
is not likely that this was established in accordance with the
provisions of the enactment. The law was to take effect in 99, and
a change of party took place before that time which sent Marius
into practical banishment and rewarded his partisan, Saturninus,
with death. The optimates who were now in office paid no attention
to the law, and the senators forgot their oath. Another injury is
added to the many which the Latini had suffered.</p>

<p>In the year 99, <i>i.e.</i>, in the year following the death of
Saturninus, an agrarian law was proposed by the tribune Titius, but
we know nothing of its conditions. Cicero is the only writer who
mentions it and even his text is doubtful.<span class=
"note">[10]</span> According to one of his statements Titius was
banished because he had preserved a portrait of Saturninus, and the
knights deemed him for this reason a seditious citizen. Valerius
Maximus, who without doubt borrowed his facts from Cicero, states
that "Titius had rendered himself dear to the people by having<span
class="note">[11]</span> brought forward an agrarian law." Cicero
mentions in another place, the <i>lex Titia</i><span class=
"note">[12]</span> upon the same page as the <i>lex Saturnina</i>
and implies that it had been enacted. If so it was disregarded and
thus rendered void.</p>

<p>In 91 an agrarian law was proposed by Livius Drusus, the son of
the adversary of Gaius Gracchus, and, with his new judiciary, the
measure was carried and became a law.<span class="note">[13]</span>
The Italians were embraced in this law and were to have equal
rights with Roman citizens, but Drusus died before he had time to
carry his law into execution, and his law died with him.</p>

<h4><a name="III15">SEC. 15.</a>&mdash;EFFECT OF THE SULLAN
REVOLUTION.</h4>

<br />
<p>As soon as Sulla found himself established, he caused a bill to
pass the Comitia Centuriata by means of which he was empowered to
inflict punishment upon certain Italian communities. For the
accomplishment of this purpose commissioners were appointed to
co&ouml;perate with the garrisons established throughout all Italy.
The less guilty were required to pay fines, pull down their walls,
and raze their citadels.<span class="note">[1]</span> Those that
had been guilty of continued opposition, as Samnium, Lucania, and
Etruria, had their territory in whole or in part confiscated, their
municipal rights cancelled, immunities taken from them, which had
been granted by old treaties, and the Roman franchise,<span class=
"note">[2]</span> which they had been granted by the Cinnan
government, annulled. Such persons received, instead, the lowest
Latin rights which did not even imply membership in any community
and rendered them destitute of civic constitution and the right of
making a testament.<span class="note">[3]</span> This latter
treatment applied only to those whose land was confiscated. Thus
Sulla vindicated the majesty of the Republic and at the time
avoided furnishing his enemies with a nucleus in Italian
communities. In Campania, the democratic colony established at
Capua by Cinna<span class="note">[4]</span> was done away with and
the domain given back to the state, thus becoming <i>ager
publicus</i>. The whole territory of Praeneste and Norba in Latium,
and Spoletium in Umbria was confiscated. The town of Sulmo in
Pelignium was razed. But more direful than all this was the
punishment which fell upon Etruria<span class="note">[5]</span> and
Samnium. These people had marched upon Rome and, with the avowed
determination of exterminating the Roman people, had engaged in
battle at the Colline gate. They were utterly destroyed and their
country left desolate. The territory of Samnium was not even opened
up for settlement, but left as a lair for wild beasts. Henceforth
from the Rubicon to the Straits of Sicily there were to be none but
Romans; the laws and the language of the whole peninsula were to be
the laws<span class="note">[6]</span> and the language of Rome.</p>

<p>To accomplish such an object as this, it was not enough to
destroy and make desolate, it became necessary to repopulate the
waste places and rebuild that which had been torn down. Roman
citizens had to be sent as colonists into the desolate regions.
Sulla, accordingly, undertook to carry out his plans of
colonization, the grandest and most comprehensive which Rome had
ever seen, and which indeed have had no parallel in history till
the settlement of the north of Ireland by Cromwell and William III.
The arrangements as to the property of the Italian soil placed at
the disposal of Sulla<span class="note">[7]</span> all the Roman
domain lands which had been placed in usufruct to the allied
communities, and which now reverted to the Roman government. It
also placed at his disposal all the confiscated territories of the
communities incurring punishment. Upon these territories he
established military colonies, and thus obtained a three-fold
result.<span class="note">[8]</span> He remunerated his soldiers
for the faithful service rendered him in long years of toil and
danger. He repeopled the regions desolated by war (except Samnium).
He provided a military protection for himself and the new
constitution which he established.</p>

<p>Most of his new settlements were directed to Etruria, Faesulae
and Arretium being among the number; others, to Latium<span class=
"note">[9]</span> and Campania, where Praeneste and Pompeii became
Sullan colonies. A great part of these colonies were, after the
Gracchan manner, merely grafted upon town-communities already
existing. The comprehensiveness of these settlements may be seen in
this fact that 20,000 allotments were<span class="note">[10]</span>
made in different parts of Italy. Notwithstanding this vast
disposal of territory, Sulla gave lands to the temple of Diana at
Mt. Tifata, while the territory of Volaterrae and Arretium remained
undisturbed. He also revived the old plan of occupation which had
been legally forbidden in the year 118. Many of Sulla's intimate
friends availed themselves of this method of becoming masters of
large estates.</p>

<h4><a name="III16">SEC. 16.</a>&mdash;AGRARIAN MOVEMENTS BETWEEN
86 AND 59.</h4>

<br />
<p>The first agrarian movement after the Sullan Revolution was that
inaugurated by the tribune Rullus. This has become the most famous
of all the agrarian laws because of the speeches made against it by
the great adversary of Rullus, Cicero, who succeeded in defeating
the measure by reason of his brilliant rhetoric. Plutarch<span
class="note">[1]</span> has thus analyzed this proposition. "The
tribunes of the people proposed dangerous innovations; they
demanded the establishment of ten magistrates with absolute power,
who, while disposing, as masters, of Italy, Syria, and the new
conquests of Pompey, should have the right to sell the public
lands; to prosecute those whom they wished; to banish; to establish
colonies; to draw upon the public treasury for whatever money they
had need; to levy and maintain what troops they deemed necessary.
The concession of so widely extended power gained for the support
of the law the most powerful men in Rome. The colleague of Cicero,
Antonius, was one of the first to favor it, in the hope of being
one of the decemvirs. Cicero opposed the new law in the senate and
his eloquence so completely overpowered even the tribunes that they
had not one word to reply. But they returned to the charge and
having gained the support of the people, they brought the matter
before the tribes. Cicero was in no way alarmed; he left the
senate, appeared on the rostrum before the people and spoke with so
great force that he not only caused the law to be rejected but took
from the tribunes all hope of being successful in similar
enterprises."</p>

<p>In 61 we find Cicero advocating a bill similar in nature to the
one he had so brilliantly combatted in 64. In the last instance,
however, the law was proposed by Pompey, and in favor of Pompey's
soldiers and that made all difference to a man who ever curried
favor with the great. Flavius, who proposed this law, was but the
creature of Pompey. Cicero has made known to us, in one of his
letters to Atticus, the conditions of the law which Flavius
proposed and the modifications which he himself wished to apply to
it. Flavius proposed to distribute lands both to the soldiers of
Pompey and the people; to establish colonies; to use for the
purchase of the lands for colonization, the subsidies which should
accrue in five years, from the recently conquered territories.<span
class="note">[2]</span> The senate rejected this law entirely, in
the same spirit of opposition which it had shown to all agrarian
laws, probably thinking that Pompey would thereby obtain too great
an increase of power.<span class="note">[3]</span> This was the
last attempt at agrarian legislation until the year 59, when Julius
Caesar enacted his famous law.</p>

<h4><a name="III17">SEC. 17.</a>&mdash;LEX JULIA AGRARIA.</h4>

<br />
<p>During the first consulship of Caius Julius C&aelig;sar, he
brought forward an agrarian<span class="note">[1]</span> bill at
the instigation of his confederates. The main object of this bill
was to furnish land to the Asiatic army<span class=
"note">[2]</span> of Pompey, In fine, this bill was little more
than a renewal of a bill presented by Pompey the previous year
(58), but rejected. Appian gives the following account of this
bill: "As soon as C&aelig;sar and Bibulus<span class=
"note">[3]</span> (his colleague) entered on the consulship, they
began to quarrel and to make preparation to support their parties
by force. But C&aelig;sar who possessed great powers of
dissimulation, addressed Bibulus in the senate and urged him to
unanimity on the ground that their disputes would damage the public
interests. Having in this way obtained credit for peaceable
intentions, he threw Bibulus off his guard, who had no suspicion of
what was going on, while C&aelig;sar, meanwhile, was marshalling a
strong force, and introducing into the senate laws for favoring the
poor, under which he proposed to distribute land among them and the
best land in Italy, that about<span class="note">[4]</span> Capua
which at the present time was let on public account.<span class=
"note">[5]</span> He proposed to distribute this land among heads
of families who had three children, by which measure he could gain
the good will of a large multitude, for the number of those who had
three children was 20,000. This proposal met with opposition from
many of the senators, and C&aelig;sar, pretending to be much vexed
at their unfair behavior, left the house and never called the
senate together again during the remainder of his consulship, but
addressed the people from the rostra. He, in the presence of the
assembly, asked the opinion of Pompeius and Crassus, both of them
approving, and the people came to vote on them (the bills), with
concealed daggers. Now as the <span class="note">[6]</span> was not
convened, for one consul could not summon the senate without the
consent of the other consul, the senators used to meet at the house
of Bibulus, but they could make no real opposition to C&aelig;sar's
power.... Now C&aelig;sar secured the enactment of the laws, and
bound the people by an oath to the perpetual observance of them,
and he required the same oath from the senate. As many of the
senators opposed him, and among them Cato, C&aelig;sar proposed
death as a penalty for not taking the oath and the assembly
ratified this proposal. Upon this all took the oath immediately
because of fear, and the tribunes also took it, for there was no
longer any use in making opposition after the proposal was
ratified."</p>

<p>This agrarian law did not affect the existing rights of property
and heritable possession. It destined for distribution only the
Italian domain land, that is to say, merely the territory of Capua,
as this was all that belonged to the state.<span class=
"note">[7]</span> If this was not enough to satisfy the demand,
other Italian lands were to be bought out of the revenue from the
eastern provinces at the taxable value rated in the censorial
rolls. The number of persons settled on the <i>Campanus ager</i> is
said<span class="note">[8]</span> to have been 20,000 citizens who
had each three children or more. The land was not distributed by
lot, but at the pleasure of the commissioners, each one receiving
some 30 jugera.<span class="note">[9]</span> If 20,000 heads of
families with their wives and three children in each family were
settled in Campania, the whole number of settlers would be 100,000.
This great number could scarcely leave Rome at one time, and we
find that as late as 51 the land was not all assigned.<span class=
"note">[10]</span> While the tenor of the law does not imply that
it was the intention to reward military service with grants of
land, yet we may be sure that the veterans of Pompey were not
forgotten.<span class="note">[11]</span> There are no extant
authorities which speak of the settlement of the Campanian land
that say any thing about the soldiers settled there, unless it be
Cicero. He speaks of the Campanian territory being taken out of the
class that contributed a revenue to the state in order that it
might be given to soldiers,<span class="note">[12]</span> and he
appears to refer to this time (59). Mommsen says that "the old
soldiers as well as the temporary lessees to be ejected were simply
recommended to the special consideration of the land
distributors."<span class="note">[13]</span> These latter were a
commission of twenty appointed by the state. C&aelig;sar, at his
own request, was excused from serving, but Pompey and Crassus were
the chief ones, thus furnishing sufficient reason for supposing
that the soldier was provided for. The passage of this bill
amounted in substance to the re&euml;stablishment of the democratic
colony founded by Marius and Cinna and afterwards abolished by
Sulla.<span class="note">[14]</span> Capua now became a Roman
colony after having had no municipal constitution for one hundred
and fifty-two years, when the city with all its dependencies was
made a prefecture administered by a prefect of Rome. The revenues
from this district were doubtless no longer needed, as those from
Pontus and Syria<span class="note">[15]</span> supplied all the
needs of the government, but it is difficult to see what benefit
could be reaped from the ejection of the thrifty farmers who, as
tenants of the state, cultivated this territory and paid their
rents regularly into the state coffers. Wherever the new settlers
were brought in, the old cultivators were turned out. No ancient
writer says anything about the condition of these people. Cicero,
in his second speech upon the land bill of Rullus, when speaking of
the consequences that would follow its enactment, declared that if
the Campanian cultivators were ejected they would have no place to
go, and he truly says that such a measure would not be a settlement
of plebeians upon the land, but an ejection and expulsion of them
from it.<span class="note">[16]</span></p>

<p>Did it pay to send out a swarm of 100,000 idle paupers<span
class="note">[17]</span> who, for two generations, had been fed at
the public charge from the corn-bins of Rome, simply in order that
a like number of honest peasants, who had been not only
self-supporting but had paid a large part of the Roman revenue,
should be compelled to sacrifice their goods in a glutted market
and become debauched and idle?</p>

<h4><a name="III18">SEC. 18.</a>&mdash;DISTRIBUTION OF LAND AFTER
THE CIVIL WAR BETWEEN C&AElig;SAR AND POMPEY.</h4>

<br />
<p>After Pompey had been vanquished at Pharsalia, and the
republicans in Africa, C&aelig;sar proceeded to distribute lands to
his soldiers in accordance with his promise to give them lands,
"not by taking them from their proprietors as Sulla did; not by
mixing colonists with citizens despoiled of their goods and thus
breeding perpetual strife,&mdash;but by dividing both public land
and his own private property,<span class="note">[1]</span> and, if
this were not sufficient, by buying what was needed." Appian says
that Caesar did not succeed in carrying out these promises in full,
but that veterans were in some cases settled upon lands legally
belonging to others.<span class="note">[2]</span> However, his
soldiers were not huddled together like those of Sulla, in military
colonies of their own, but when they settled in Italy they were
scattered<span class="note">[3]</span> as much as possible
throughout the entire peninsula in order to make them more easily
amenable to the laws.<span class="note">[4]</span> In Campania,
where C&aelig;sar had lands at his disposal, the soldiers were
settled in colonies, and so, close together. According to a letter
of Cicero to Paetus, among the lands distributed were those of Veii
and Capena. Historians have estimated that there were 100,000
soldiers who received lands in Italy by this distribution.</p>

<br />
<h4><a name="III19">SEC. 19.</a>&mdash;DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE DEATH
OF C&AElig;SAR TO THE TIME OF AUGUSTUS.</h4>

<br />
<p>The <a name="III19a">death of C&aelig;sar</a> in no way stopped
the assignment of lands, but rather rendered all possession of land
in Italy unsafe. A few weeks after his death two new laws were
promulgated, one by the tribune, Lucius Antonius,<span class=
"note">[1]</span> a <i>lex agraria</i>, and the other the <i>lex de
colonis in agros deducendis</i> by the consul Marcus Antonius. The
first was enacted on the 5th of June,<span class="note">[2]</span>
and ordered that all the <i>ager publicus</i> still at the disposal
of the state, including the Pomptine marshes which C&aelig;sar had
at one time planned to drain, but had not, be divided among the
veterans and citizens. It was abrogated by a <i>senatus
consultum</i> of the 4th of January, 43,<span class=
"note">[3]</span> but was nevertheless carried into execution
almost immediately with great relentlessness towards the
enemies<span class="note">[4]</span> of Antonius. The second, the
<i>Lex Antonia</i>, perished in April of 44, and had as a result
the establishment of a colony near Casilinum,<span class=
"note">[5]</span> which C&aelig;sar had already colonized; the
remainder of the domain lands, the <i>ager Campanus</i> and <i>ager
Leontinus</i>, was converted into a reward for the supporters of
Antonius.<span class="note">[6]</span> This was also set aside by
the new law of the consul C. Vibius Pansa, in February, 43.<span
class="note">[7]</span></p>

<p><i><a name="III19c">Second Triumvirate</a>.</i> When Antony,
Lepidus, and Octavius were reconciled, thus forming the second
triumvirate, the treaty sanctioning this new state of affairs
stipulated, in favor of the soldiers, a new distribution of lands,
<i>i.e.</i>, a new agrarian law; Appian says:&mdash;"In order to
increase the zeal of the army, the triumvirs promised to the
soldiers, independent<span class="note">[8]</span> of other results
of victory and a gratuity of colonies, 18 Italian towns, important
by means of their wealth and the richness of their lands. These
were divided among the soldiers with their lands and buildings, as
conquered towns. Among the number were Capua, Rhegium, Venusia,
Beneventum, Nuceria and Vibo. Thus the most beautiful part of Italy
became the prey of the soldiers."</p>

<p>Dion Cassius, Suetonius and Velleius Paterculus all mention
these assignments. After the battle of Philippi and the defeat and
death of Brutus and Cassius, 170,000 men were provided for, in
accordance with these promises, out of the goods of the proscribed
and the lands confiscated to the state. The lands of the towns
mentioned in Appian were taken under the form of a forced sale, but
the purchase money was never paid owing to the bankrupt condition
of the treasury.</p>

<p>If we examine into the nature of these agrarian laws since the
death of Julius Caesar, we shall find that they differ in all
respects from previous enactments:</p>

<p>1. They were executed at the expense not only of public domains
but also of private property.</p>

<p>2. They were the work of one man and not of the entire
people.</p>

<p>3. The name of the people was never mentioned in these laws;
they were enacted wholly for the profit of the soldiery. Before the
distributions made by the triumvirate, the public lands had been
absorbed, or at least the fragments remaining were in no way
sufficient to recompense the service of the veterans.</p>

<p>Upon the establishment of the empire, the public lands became a
vast manorial estate whose over-lord was the emperor himself.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
